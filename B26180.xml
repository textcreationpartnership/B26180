            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He words of dying men usually are very serious, weighty, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. The ensuing notes being the Preachers last legacies to their several congregations, a little before their civil, though vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary death; by reason of the great concourse of people that were then assembled in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to hear their dying Pastors
<pb facs="tcp:173109:4"/> preach their own funeral sermons whilest they were yet alive; many being too distant from them, or too much disturbed by the crowd, fell short of their share and portion in them; others having lost much of what they committed to their memories, addressed themselves to their friends that writ; but it being found too tedious a work to satisfy the desires of all by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions some who had taken after them as followeth, by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of many, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with for the satisfaction of their friends, to expose their notes to publick view. It is not to be expected (though all care and faithfulness hath been used) that
<pb facs="tcp:173109:4"/> the picture should answer the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in all things; what defects therefore in any kind may be found herein, we humbly pray may not be imputed to the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but unto the publishers hereof. We conceive we need not adde any thing to take off that cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that is cast upon them, as if out of an humour, faction, or which is worse, disobedience to authority, they refused to conform; enough is said by themselves, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why they chose to take up their crosse and follow Christ, in a way of conscience and fidelity.</p>
                  <p>Reader, we will detain thee no longer from partaking of the fruit we here present thee with, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb facs="tcp:173109:5"/> praying that the lives of these worthy Ministers hearers, may be their legible Epistles, seen and read of all men; and that their conversations may be such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Gospel of Christ, that whither they (yet again) come and see them, or else be absent, they may hear of their affairs; that they stand fast in one spirit, striving together for the faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.

                     </gap>ou shall read of four Horses, when the four first Seals were opened: a white horse, a red horse, a black horse, &amp; a pale horse: after Christ had ridden on the white horse propagating the Gospel, then follows the red horse, a type of War, then the black horse, an Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick of Famine: then the pale horse, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Pestilence. Now God was resolved to ride on one of these horses, and <hi>David</hi> must choose upon which God should ride; this was a great strait: Let me present <hi>Davids</hi> lifting up his eyes to Heaven, and speaking to God thus: O my God, what is this message thou hast sent me? thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferest me three things: I am in a strait, I know which to refuse, but which to choose I know not: shall the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land flowing with milk and honey, shall this Land endure seven years Famine, and be turned into a Wilderness, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled; and shall I, whose hands thou hast taught to fight, and whose fingers to war, shall I that have subdued all my enemies, shall I in my old age, and all my Captains, flie three months before our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and be driven to caves and rocks to hide our selves? O thou my God, who art my refuge, shall I and my people be a prey to the pestilence that walketh in darkness and destruction, that walketh at noon day? O my God, I know not what to do, <hi>I am in a great strait.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second reason why this strait was so great, was, because of the guilt of sin that lay on <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:173109:7"/> spirit: for <hi>David</hi> knew that this severe message was the fruit of the sin he committed in numbring the people. But you will say, Why, was it a sin in <hi>David</hi> to number the people: <hi>Moses</hi> had often numbred the people: three times, and it was not counted sin. <hi>Josephus</hi> answereth, the sin of <hi>David</hi> was, because he did not require the half shekel, which he was to have had from all were numbred, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Others say he sinned in numbring all ages, whereas he was to number but from twenty years: but these are but conjectural Reasons. I conceive the sin of <hi>David</hi> was because he did it without a lawful call, and for an unlawful end: <hi>Sine causa le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittima:</hi> he sinned in the manner rather then in the matter: for there was no cause for him to number the people, but curiosity, and no end but vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>Go through all the tribes of Israel and number the people, that I may know the number of my people,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was lifted up with pride and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-confidence: he begins to boast of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his people, and to trust in an arm of flesh; therefore God sends the Prophet to <hi>David</hi> to prick the bladder of his pride; as if God should say, I will teach you to number the people by lessening the number of your people: Now the burden of his sin did add much to the burden of this heavy message: <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. <hi>After David had numbred the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his heart smote him:</hi> the message smites him, and his heart smites him, and <hi>he said, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: now I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> had been to suffer this great
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173109:7"/> punishment out of love to God, or for a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he would not have been so distressed: There are two sorts of straits in Scripture: some suffered for God and a good conscience: and there are straits suffered for sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are straits suffered for God and a good conscience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37. Those Martyrs there were driven to great straits: but these were straits for God and a good Conscience, and these straits were the Saints greatest enlargements, they were so sweetned to them by the consolations and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations of Gods Spirit; a prison was a paradise to them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. they look joyfully at the spoiling of their goods. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. they departed from the presence of the Council, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. Straits for a good conscience are greatest enlargements; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> gloryeth in this strait, <hi>Paul a prisoner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are straits suffered for sin, and these are envenomed by the guilt of sin: sin puts poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son into all our distresses and perplexities. Now such was the strait into which <hi>David</hi> was now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: it was a strait caused by sin, and that made it so unwelcome and uncomfortable: so that from hence I gather this Observation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That sin and iniquity brings persons and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into marvellous labyrinths and perplexities: into true, real and great molestations: a man free from sin, is free in the midst of straits: a man guilty of sin, is in a strait in the midst of freedom.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:173109:8"/>
                  <p>After <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned in eating of the forbidden fruit, the whole world was a prison to him: Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise it self was an hell to him, he knew not where to hide himself from the presence of God. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Cain</hi> had murdered his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> he was brought into such a strait, that he was afraid that every one that met him would slay him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las poor <hi>Cain,</hi> how many was there then in the world? we read but his father and mother, yet such was his distress, that he crieth out, every one that met him would slay him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. Into what a strait did sin bring the old world? the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of sin brought a deluge of water to drown them. Into what a strait did sin bring <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> the fire of lust raining in <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> brought down fire from heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them. Sin brings external, internal, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal straits upon persons and nations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sin brings external straits; sin brings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Sword, and Plague; sin brings Agues and Feavours, Gout and Stone, and all manner of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases: yea, sin brings death it self, which is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of sin. Read <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. and you will see a black roul of curses, which were the fruit of sin. Sin brought <hi>Sion</hi> into <hi>Babilon;</hi> and when the Jews had murdered Christ, forty years after they were brought into that distress, when the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was besieged by <hi>Titus Vespasian,</hi> that they did eat one another, the mother did eat her child; that whereas <hi>David</hi> had a choice which of the three he would have, either Famine, Plague, or Sword: the poor Jews had all three concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173109:8"/> together in the siedge: sin brings all manner of external plagues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin brought persons and Nations into inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal straits: sin brings soul-plagues, which are worse than bodily plagues: sin brings hardness of heart, blindness of mind, a spirit of slumber, a reprobate sence; sinne brings a spiritual famine upon a Land; it brings a famine of the Word, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. sin causes God to take away the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel from a people: sin brings internal plagues: sin awakens Conscience, &amp; fills it full of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Into what a strait did sin drive <hi>Judas,</hi> after he had betrayed Christ? Into what a strait did sin drive <hi>Spira?</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in his tribulations for God: but when he speaks of his sin, he cryeth out, <hi>O miserable man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? David</hi> a valiant man, when he speaks of sin, saith, they are too heavy a burden for him to bear: <hi>A wounded conscience who can bear!</hi> saith the Wise man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sin bringeth eternal straits: O the strait that a wicked man shall be brought into at the great and dreadful day of Judgement, when all the world shall be on fire about him! when he shall call to the mountains to hide him, and to the rocks to cover him from the wrath of God: then will he cry out with <hi>David, I am, O Lord, in a great strait.</hi> And when the Wicked shall be condemned to hell, who can express the straits they then shall be in? <hi>Bind them hand &amp; foot, and cast them into everlasting darkness, Matth.</hi> 25. When a wicked man shall be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173109:9"/> bound with everlasting chains of darkness, then he will cry out, <hi>I am in a great strait.</hi> Consider what <hi>Dives</hi> saith to <hi>Abraham:</hi> he desires that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> might but dip the tip of his finger in water, and that he might cool his tongue: not his whole body, but his tongue: but that would not be granted.</p>
                  <p>It is impossible the tongue of man should set out the great straits the damned suffer in hell, both in regard of the greatness and everlastingness of them.</p>
                  <p>This is all I shall say for the Explication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 1. I chiefly aim at the Application: Doth sin bring Nations and Persons into external, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and eternal straits? then this sadly reproves those that choose to commit sin to avoid perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There are thousands in <hi>England</hi> guilty of this, that to avoid poverty, will lye, cheat and cozen; and to gain an estate, will sell God and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: and to avoid the loss of estate and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment will do any thing: they will be sure to be of that Religion which is uppermost: be it what it will. Now give me leave this morning to speak three things to these sort of men: and O that my words might prevail with them!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider it is sin only that makes trouble to deserve the name of trouble; for when we suffer for Gods sake, or a good Conscience, these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are so sweetned by the consolations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they are no troubles at all: therefore in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173109:9"/> Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes the Martyrs wrote to their friends out of prison, <hi>If you knew the Comforts we have in prison, you would wish to be with us: I am in prison before I am in prison,</hi> saith Master <hi>Sanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Famous is the story of the three Children: they were in a great strait when cast into the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; Bind them hand and foot, and cast them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Furnace; but when they were there, they were unbound: <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. saith <hi>Nebuchadezzar, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? and loe, I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</hi> I have often told you, when three are cast into the fire for a good Conscience, God will make the fourth: therefore, I say, straits and sufferings for God are not worth the name of straits. <hi>David</hi> was often driven into straits: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. he was sore distressed when his Town was burnt, and his Wives and Children taken captive by the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites:</hi> I, but that was a distress of danger, not of sin: therefore he encourageth himself in the Lord his God. <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> was in a great strait, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. <hi>We know not what to do,</hi> saith he: this was a strait of danger, not caused by his sin, and God quickly delivered him: but the strait that <hi>David</hi> was in, was caused by his sin, and that made it so bitter. I am loth to enlarge here: St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in a great strait, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.23. but this was a blessed strait, an Evangelical strait, saith Saint <hi>Chrysostom, He knew not whether to die for his own sake, or to live for the Churches sake, were best;</hi> he was willing to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173109:10"/> adjourn his going to Heaven for the good of the people of God: Nay, Christ was in a strait, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. I have a Baptisme to be baptized withall, and how am I straitned till it be accomplished? I am to shed my blood for my Elect: that is the Baptisme he speaks of.</p>
                  <p>This was a strait of dear affection to the Elect of God: all these were blessed straits: but now a strait caused by sin, these are imbittered and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed by the guilt of sin and sence of Gods Wrath. It is sin that maketh straits deserve the name of straits: therefore you are spiritually mad that commit sin to avoid straits.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is more evil in the least sin, then in the greatest outward calamity whatsoever: this the world will not believe: therefore St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>That a man ought not to tell a lie, though he might save all the world from hell: for there is more evil in one lie, than there is good in the salvation of all the world.</hi> I have often told you the story of Saint <hi>Austin:</hi> saith he, <hi>If hell were on one side, and sin on the other, and I must choose one, I would choose hell rather then sin: for God is the Author of hell, but it is blasphemy to say he is the Author of sin.</hi> There is a famous story of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth King of <hi>France,</hi> he sent a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> a zealous Protestant, gives him three things to choose, either to go to Mass, or to be put to death, or to suffer banishment all his life long: saith he, <hi>Primum Deo juvante nunquam eligo: The first (God helping) I will never choose, I abhor the idolatry of the Mass: but for the two other, I leave it to the choice of the King to do as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173109:10"/> there is more evil in the least sin then the greatest misery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing I would have you consider, that whosoever goeth out of Gods way to avoid danger, shall certainly meet with greater danger. <hi>Balaam</hi> went out of Gods way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.22. and God sent an Angel with a drawn sword, and he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon an Asse, <hi>vers.</hi> 26. the Angel stood in a narrow place, where was no way to go from the right hand or from the left: if his Ass had not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under him, he had been run through by the sword of the Angel. <hi>Jonah</hi> for fear of the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> went out of Gods way, but he met with a mighty tempest, he met with a Whale: What do you do when you commit sin? you make way to be cast into the eternal prison of hell: you destroy your precious souls to save your perishing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 2. If sin be the father and mother of all perplexity and distresses, then, I beseech you, let us above all things in the world abhor sin: all the curses of the Bible are all due only to a sinner; and all the curses not named in the Bible: for that is observable, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.36. every plague that is not written in the book shall light upon him: there are strange punishments to the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Job</hi> 31.3. Is not destruction to the wicked a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity; sin it bringeth the sinner to little ease: little ease at death, little ease at the day of judgement, and little ease in hell, tribulation and anguish: the word in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173109:11"/> the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> little ease to every soul that doth iniquity. Oh my beloved, will you promise me to look upon sin, and consider it in all its woful consequents, as the father, mother, and womb out of which come external, eternal, and internal straits? more particularly there are twelve sins I especially command you to take heed of and avoid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed of covetousness: the love of the world will peirce you through with many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; the love of money is the root of all evil; the love of the world drowns men in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of the sin of pride: into what woful strait did pride bring <hi>Haman!</hi> God crossed him in what he most desired: God made him hold the stirrup, while <hi>Mordecay</hi> rode in triumph; and God hanged him on the Gallows which he had made for <hi>Mordecay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of drunkenness; look not on the wine when it gives its colour in the cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> drunkenness will bring you into snares, it will bite like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Take heed of disobedience and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Commandments of God: it brought <hi>Jonah</hi> to the three nights and three dayes in the Whales belly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Take heed of fornication, and adultery, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173109:11"/> all uncleanness; this brought <hi>Sampson</hi> to a woful strait: this brought <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> into great perplexity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Take heed of oppression, and all acts of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: this brought <hi>Ahab</hi> into great strait, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the dogs licked his blood.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Take heed of unnecessary familiarity with wicked men: this brought <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> into a great strait.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Take heed of misusing the Prophets of God: this made God destroy the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> without remedy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Take heed of coming prophanely to the Lords Table: this brought the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> into a great distress, insomuch as the Apostle saith, <hi>For this cause many among you are sick, and many weak, and many fallen asleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Take heed of loathing the Manna of your souls: this brought the people of Israel into wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful misery, that God destroyed all their carcasses in the wilderness, save <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take heed of slighting the Gospel: this brought Queen <hi>Maries</hi> persecution, as many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly men that fled for Religions sake out of the Land, have confessed their unthankfulness for, and unfruitfulness under the Gospel in King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths time, brought the persecution in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:173109:12"/>11. Take heed of losing your first Love: that makes God threaten to take away his Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Take heed of prophaning the Christian Sabbath, which is much prophaned every where, a day that Christ by his resurrection from the dead hath consecrated, to be kept holy to God: Certainly if the Jews were so severely punished for breaking the Sabbath, which was set apart in memory of the Creation, surely God will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punish those that break the Sabbath set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in memory of Christs Resurrection. May be some will say, I have committed many of these sins, but am not brought into any strait. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was nine months after <hi>David</hi> had numbred the people, before he was in this strait: but as sure as God is in heaven, sin will bring straits sooner or later; though a sinner a hundred years, yet shall he be accursed: may be thy prosperity makes way for thy damnation: and this is thy greatest distress, that thou goest on in sin and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 3. If sin bringeth a Nation into marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous labyrinths, learn what great cause we have to fear that God should bring this Nation into great distress, because of the great abominations are committed in the midst of it: our King and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign was in great strait in the dayes of his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but God hath delivered him: God hath delivered this Nation out of great straits; but alas we requite God evil for good, and instead of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173109:12"/> repenting of old sins we commit new sins. I am told there are new oaths invented, oaths not fit to be named in any place, much less here: Certainly the drunkenness and adultery, the oppression and injustice, the bribery and Sabbath-breaking, the vain and wicked swearing and for-swearing this Nation is guilty of, must of necessity provoke God to say of us as he did of them in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 15.29. <hi>Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord?</hi> shall not my soul be avenged on such a Nation as this? God will not only punish us, but be avenged on us. There is no way to avoid a national desolation but by a national reformation.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, learn what cause you of this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Parish, what cause you have to expect that God should bring you into great straits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of your great unthankfulness and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness under the means of Grace, you that have so long enjoyed the Gospel; you have had the Gospel in this place in great abundance; Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> he served an appertenticeship in this place: Doctor <hi>Straughton</hi> served another apprenticeship, and I, through divine Mercy, have served three apprenticeships, and half another almost, among you; you have had the Spirit of God seven and thirty years in the faithful ministry of the Word knocking at the door of your hearts, but many of you have hardened your hearts. Are there not some of you, I only put the question, that begin to loath the Manna of your souls, and to look back towards <hi>Egypt</hi> again? Are there not some of you have itching ears, and would fain have Preachers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173109:13"/> that would feed you with dainty phrases, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin not to care for a Minister that unrips your Consciences, speaks to your hearts and souls, and would force you into heaven by frighting you out of your sins? Are there not some of you, that by often hearing Sermons are become Sermon proof, that know to sleep and scoffe away Sermons? I would be glad to say there are but few such; but the Lord knoweth there are too too many that by long preaching get little good by preaching, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I have often said it, and say it now again, there is hardly any way to raise the price of the Gospel-Ministry, but by the want of it: And that I may not flatter you, you have not profited under the means you have enjoyed; therefore you may justly expect God may bring you into a strait, and take away the Gospel from you: God may justly take away your Ministers by death or other wayes. Have you not lost yovr first Love? why did God take away the Gospel from the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but because they lost their first Love? Are you not like the Church of <hi>Laodecea,</hi> that are neither hot nor cold? therefore God may justly spew you out of his mouth: what God will do with you, I know not; a few weeks will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: God can make a great change in a little time: we leave all to God: but in the mean time let me commend one Text of Scripture to you, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Give glory to the Lord your God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dark mountains, and while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness:</hi> Verse 17. <hi>But if you will not hear it, my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173109:13"/> soul shall weep in secret places for your pride, and mine eyes shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the Lords flock is carried away captive.</hi> Give glory to God by confessing and repenting of your sins, by humbling your souls before the Lord, before darkness come, and who knoweth but this may prevent darkness?</p>

                  <p>It is the first of these that I intend: the title that the Apostle gives to his children, <hi>Dearly beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence observe this Doctrine.</p>
                  <q>That the affections of a right Gospel-Minister to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people are very ardent.</q>
                  <p>Dearly beloved, there are two things in every Minister of Christ that are much exercised: his head and his heart, his head with labour, and his heart with love: his head with labour in the work of the Ministry: if done aright, it is a work fitter for Angels then for men: it is our work to open the Oracles of God, even those sacred profound things that the Angels search into: and if God did not help us, we might soon sink under the weight of such a burden: and as a Ministers head is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with labour, so his heart is exercised with love, &amp; it is hard to say which of the two exceeds: his labour or his love. Thus is it here in the Text, <hi>my dearly beloved:</hi> in these words we have Saint <hi>Paul</hi> laying siege to these <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and labouring to make a happy victory, to conquer them with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>dearly beloved.</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> heart was the spring of love, his lips were the pipe, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were the cistern into which this spring did run. This holy Apostle was a mirror and pattern of love, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sinning <hi>Corinthians: Pauls</hi> tears did drop towards the praying <hi>Corinthians,</hi> his love did burn:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173109:15"/> holy <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Seraphin,</hi> his heart did burn in a flame of affection to his people: how many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do we find scattered in his Epistles? he tells his people, which sometimes he did write to, and sometimes he preached to, he looked after their souls more then their silver, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. <hi>We seek not yours but you:</hi> as a tender nurse cherisheth her childe with the breast, so Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the breast-milk of the Word, in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.8. this man of God did not only bestow a Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, but was willing to impart his very soul to them if it might save theirs, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.7. <hi>We were willing to have imparted to you our own souls, because you are dear unto us:</hi> Such was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> affection to his people, that without a complement he loved them more then his life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>if I be offered upon the sacrifice &amp; service of your faith, I rejoyce with you all:</hi> that is as if he had said, If it be so that my blood be poured forth as a sacrifice, if my death may be any way serviceable unto you, if it may help forward the strengthning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of your faith, I am willing to die, I rejoyce to do it: so full of affections was this Apostle, that he could not choose but love his people, though the more he did love, the lesse he should be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: In 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.15. oh how did <hi>Paul</hi> sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all his Sermons with love, in 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. if he reproved sin, yet he was angry in love; he dipt the pill in sugar, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. <hi>How turn you again to weak and beggarly elements! you observe dayes, and months, and years; I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain;</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:173109:16"/> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am. See how Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chides their sins, and yet at the same time courts their souls: no sooner did he lanch the wound, but presently he poured in wine and oyl into it: so did <hi>Paul</hi> love his people, that he would not justly give any offence to the weakest believer. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If meat make my brother to offend, I will never eat flesh more whilst the world stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Paul</hi> was like some tender mother, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears to eat those meats that she might, for fear of hurting the child that she gives suck to. Thus you see he was a spiritual father made up of love: and surely, my brethren, this affection in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is in all the true Ministers of Jesus Christ, they are full of sympathy and bowels unto those over whom the holy Ghost hath made them Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers.</p>
                  <p>I shall only glance at the Reasons why it will be thus, and why it should be thus, that such flaming affections there should be in all Christs Ministers to their people.</p>
                  <p>It will be thus for these two Reasons briefly.</p>
                  <p>First, from that principle within that teacheth Love. Grace doth not fire the heart with passion, but with compassion. Grace in the heart of a Minister files off that ruggedness that is in his spirit, making him loving and courteous. <hi>Paul</hi> once breathed out persecution: but when Grace came, this bramble was turned into a spiritual Vine, twisting himself about the souls of his people with loving embraces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there will be this ardent love in a ministers heart, from that spiritual relation that is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173109:16"/> betwixt him and his people: he is a spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and shall we think him to be without bowels! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though you have ten thousand instructers, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.</hi> Some he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets unto Christs, others he build up in Christ. Doth not a father provide chearfully for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? can a father see bread taken from his childe and not have his heart affected with it? is it not a grief to a parent to see his child put out to a drie Nurse?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there should be this ardent love and affection in all Gods Ministers for this reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the liveliest way to do most good: knotty and stubborn hearts will soonest be wrought upon with kindness. The fire melteth the hardest metal; the fire of love with Gods blessing will melt the most obdurate sinner. A <hi>Boanarges,</hi> a son of consolation, who comes in the spirit of love and meekness, is the fittest to do a piece of Gospel-chirurgery, to restore and put such an one in joynt again that is overtaken with a fault. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Restore such a one with the spirit of love and meekness.</hi> Thus much in short for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal part.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave now to make some applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And first, here are several Inferences that may be drawn from this: As</p>
                  <p>First, see here the right character of a Gospel-Minister: He is full of love, he exhorts, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, he reproves, and all in love; he is never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his people, but because they will not be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173109:17"/> saved? How loth is a Minister of Christ to see pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious souls, like so many jewels, cast over-board in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dead Sea of hell? A conscientious Minister would count it an unhappy gain, to gain the world and lose the souls of his people: he saith, as the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Give me the persons, and take thee the goods,</hi> Gen. 14.21.</p>
                  <p>The second branch of Information is this; Are true Gospel-Ministers so full of love? then how sad is it to have such Ministers put upon a people as have no love to souls? The work of the ministry, it is a labour of love: Oh how sad is it to have such in the ministry, that can neither labour nor love? that are such as are without bowels, that look more at tyths then at souls? It must needs be sad with a people in any part of the world to have such ministers set over them, as either poyson them with error, or do what in them lies to damn them by their wicked example: How can the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil reprove sin? how can the Minister cry out in the Pulpit against drunkenness, that will himself be drunk? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Thou that teachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayest a man ought not to commit adultery, doest thou commit adultery?</hi> We read that the snuffers of the Tabernacle were to be made of pure gold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37.23. those who by their calling are to reprove and snuffe off the sins of others, they should be pure gold, holy persons. In the Law God did appoint the lip of the Leper should be covered; he ought to have his lip cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he should not be permitted to speak the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, who though he be by office an Angel, yet by life is a Leper.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:173109:17"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, see from hence the happiness of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister who is placed among such a people as give him abundant cause of love: How happy is he that can say to his people from his heart, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>my dearly beloved!</hi> And here let me speak by way of encouragement to you of this Parish; I find St. <hi>Paul</hi> commending the good he saw in his people, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.3. <hi>We are bound to thank God alwayes for you beloved, because your faith grows exceedingly.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> is commending his people: in imitation of this Apostle, let me at this time speak a commendatory word to you; I have exercised my Ministry now among you for almost sixteen years, and I rejoyce and bless God that I cannot say, The more I love you, the lesse I am loved; I have received many signal demonstrations of love from you: though other Parishes have exceeded you for number of houses, yet I think not for strength of affection. I have with much comfort observed your reverent attention to the Word preached; you rejoyced in this light not for a season, but to this day: I have observed your zeal against error, and as much as could be expected in a critical time, your unity and amity: this is your honour, and if for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there should be any interruption made in my Ministry among you, though I should not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to preach to you, yet I shall not cease to love you, and to pray for you: but why should there be an interruption made? where is the crime? Some indeed say, that we are disloyal and seditious? Beloved, what my actings and sufferings for his Majesty have been, is known not to a few of you: but however we must go to Heaven through good
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:173109:18"/> report and thorough bad report: and it is well if we can get to glory, though we pass through the pikes. I shall endeavour that I may still approve the sincerity of my love to you: I will not promise that I shall still preach among you, nor will I say that I shall not; I desire to be guided by the silver thread of Gods Word, and of Gods Providence: my heart is toward you: there is, you know, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in the late Act, that we shall be now short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if we were naturally dead; and if I must die, let me leave some legacy with you before I go from you: I cannot but give you some counsel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for your souls, and I hope there is no hurt in that: There are, my beloved, these twenty directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I desire you to take special notice of, which I would leave as advice and counsel with you about your souls.</p>
                  <p>First, I beseech you, keep your constant hours every day with God; the godly man is a man set apart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.3. not only because God hath set him apart by election, but because he hath set himself apart by devotion. Give God the <hi>Aurorae fillium,</hi> begin the day with God, visit God in the morning before you make any other visits: wind up your hearts towards heaven in the morning, and they will go the better all the day after. O turn your Closets into Temples: read the Scriptures: the two Testaments are the two lips by which God speaks to us; these will make you wise unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the Scripture is both a glass to shew you your spots, and a laver to wash them away: besiege hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every day with prayer: thus perfume your houses, and keep a constant intercourse with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:173109:18"/>
                  <p>Secondly, get good books into your houses: when you have not the spring near to you, then get water into your cistern; so when you have not that wholsome preaching that you desire, good books are cisterns that hold the waters of life, in them to refresh you. When <hi>Davids</hi> natural heat was taken away, they covered him with warm clothes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. so when you find a chilness upon your souls, and that your former heat begins to abate, ply your selves with warm clothes; get those good books that may acquaint you with such truths as may warm and affect your hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, have a care of your company: take heed of unnecessary familiarity with sinners: we cannot cetch health from another, but we may soon cetch a disease: the disease of sin is very cetching: I would be as fraid of coming among the wicked, as among those that have the plague, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.35. <hi>They were mingled with the heathen &amp; learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their works:</hi> if we cannot make others better, let us have a care that they make not us worse. <hi>Lot</hi> was a miracle, he kept fresh in <hi>Sodomes</hi> salt-water. My beloved, take heed of the occasions of sin: evil company is an occasion of sin. The <hi>Nazarites</hi> in the old Law, as they might drink no wine, so they were forbidden grapes, whereof the wine was made, as you read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. to teach us, that all occasions of sin must be avoided: evil company is, <hi>hellus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum,</hi> the Devils draw-net, by which he draws millions to Hell: How many families and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny souls have been ruined and undone in this City by evil company? many there are that go from a Play-house to a Whore-house, and from a Tavern to Tyburn.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:173109:19"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, have a care whom ye hear; it is our Saviour Christs counsel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Beware of false Prophets, that come to you in sheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.</hi> Let me tell you, the Devil hath his Ministers as well as Christ: <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. <hi>The Serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman:</hi> that is, as the learned expound it, Satan by his Ministers and Emissaries cast out the flood of <hi>Arrian</hi> doctrine to drown the Church. There are some, who by the subtilty of their wit have learned the Art to mix error with truth, and to give poyson in a golden cup. Take heed who you hear, and how you hear; be like those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bereans,</hi> that searched the Scriptures whether the things that they preached were so or not, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. Your ears must not be like spunges that suck in puddle-water as well as wine; but your ears must be like a fan, that fans out the chaffe, but retains the pure wheat: you must be like those in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.48. that gathered the good fish into vessels, but cast the bad away. The Saints are called Virgins for their wisdom: they will not let every one defile their souls with error; they have a judicious ear, and a critical palate, that can distinguish betwixt truth and error, and put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt meat of Gods sending, and the Devils cooking.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, study sincerity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.6. <hi>Behold thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest truth in the inward part:</hi> be what you seem to be: be not like Rowers in a Barge, that look one way and row another: Do not look heaven-ward by your profession, and row hell-ward by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: do not pretend to love God, and yet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:173109:19"/> love sin: <hi>Simulata sanctitas, duplicata iniquitas:</hi> Counterfeit piety is double iniquity. Let your hearts be upright with God: the plainer the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is, the richer it is; and the more plain the heart is, the more doth God value this jewel: A little rusty gold is far better then a great deal of bright brass: a little true Grace, though rusted over with many infirmities, is better then all the glistering shews of hypocrites: a sincere heart is Gods currant coin, and he will give it grains of allowance.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, as you love your souls, be not strangers to your selves; be much and often in the work of self-examination; among all the books that you read, turn over the book of your own heart; look into the book of conscience, see what is written there: <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.6. <hi>I commune with mine own heart:</hi> Set up a judgement seat in your own souls; examine whether you have grace or not: prove whether you are in the faith: be as much afraid of a painted holiness as you would be afraid of going to a painted heaven: Do not think your selves good, because others think so: let the Word be the touch-stone, by which you try your hearts: let the Word be the looking-glass, by which you judge of the complexion of your souls: for want of this self-searching many live known to others, and die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to themselves.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, keep your spiritual watch, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.37. what I say unto you I say unto all, watch: if it were the last word I should speak, it should be this word, watch. O what need hath a Christian to be ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his watch! the heart is a subtle piece, and will
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173109:20"/> be stealing out to vanity, and if we are not careful it will decoy us into sin: we have a special eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such persons as we suspect: thy heart is a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious person: O have an eye upon it, watch it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: it is a bosom traytor. <hi>Job</hi> set a watch before his eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. We must every day keep sentinel: sleep not upon your guard: our sleeping time is the Devils tempting time: let not not your watch candle go out.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, you that are the people of God, do you often ossociate together, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. they that feared the Lord, spake often one to another, Christs Doves should flock together: one Christian will help to heat another: a single coal of Juniper will soon die, but many coals put together, will keep life one in another. Conference sometimes may do as much good as preaching: one Christian by good discourse drops holy oyl upon another, that makes the lamp of his grace to shine the brighter. It is great wisdom to keep up the trade in a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Christians by meeting often together, setting good discourse on foot, keep up the trade of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that else would decay &amp; soon be lost. Is not the communion of Saints an Article in our Creed? Do not then live so asunder, as if this Article were blotted out. The Naturalists observe there is a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in Plants; they say some Plants bear better when they grow near other plants, as the Vine and the Elme, the Olive and the Myrtle thrive best when they grow together: it is true in Religion, the Saints are trees of righteousness, that thrive best in godliness when they grow together.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, get your hearts screwed up above the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173109:20"/> world; set your affections upon things above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. We may see the face of the Moon in the water, but the Moon is fixed above in the Firmament: so though a Christian walks here below, yet his heart should be fixed above in Heaven: in Heaven there is our best kindred, our purest joy, our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-house; O let our hearts be above: it is the best and the sweetest kind of life: the higher the bird flies, the sweeter it sings: and the higher the heart is raised above the world, the sweeter joy it hath. The Eagle that flies in the air, is not stung by the Serpent: those whose hearts are elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the lower Region of this world, are not stung with the vexations and disquietments that others are, but are full of joy and contentment.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Trade much in the promises: the promises are great supports to faith; faith lives in a promise as the fish lives in the water: the promises are both comforting and quickening: they are <hi>mitralia evangelii,</hi> the very breasts of the Gospel: as the child by sucking the breasts gets strength; so faith by sucking the breast of a promise gets strength and revives. The promises of God are bladders to keep us from sinking when we come into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of affliction: the promises are sweet clusters of grapes that grow upon Christ the true Vine. O trade much in the promises: there is no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you can be in, but you have a promise: the promises are like Manna, that sute themselves to every Christians palate.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To all you that hear me, live in a calling. <hi>Jerome</hi> gave his friend this advice to be ever well employed, that when the Devil came to tempt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173109:21"/> him, he might find him working in his vineyard, Sure I am, the same God that saith, <hi>Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,</hi> saith also, <hi>Six days shalt thou labour.</hi> The great God never sealed any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to idleness: an idle professour is the shame of his profession, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.11. <hi>I hear there are some,</hi> sayes the Apostle, <hi>that work not at all, but are busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies: such we exhort, by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work. Solon</hi> made Laws to punish idleness; and <hi>Cicero</hi> saith of an idle man, <hi>Spiritum trahit, non vivit,</hi> he draws his breath, but doth not live, he is not useful: but a good Christian acts within the sphere of his own calling.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Let me intreat you to joyn the first and the second Table together: piety to God, and equity to your Neighbour: the Apostle puts these two words together in one verse, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12. <hi>That we should live righteously and godly:</hi> righteously, that relates to mortality; godly, that relates to piety and sanctity: alwayes remember this, every Command hath the same Divine stamp and authority as another Command hath. I would try a moral man by the duties of the first Table, &amp; I would try a professor by the duties of the second Table: Some pretend faith, but have no wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks; others have works, but they have no faith: Some pretend zeal for God, but are not just in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; others are just in their dealings, but have not one spark of zeal for God. If you would go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you must turn both sides to the Table, the first and second Table, joyn piety &amp; mortality together: as we blame the Papists for blotting out the second Commandment, let not the Papists blame us for leaving out the second Table.</p>

The plea of a Multitude will not hold at Gods bar; when God shall ask you, why did you prophane my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, why were you drunk, why did you break your Oaths? to say then, Lord, Because most men did so, will be but a poor plea; God will say to you, Then seeing you have sinned with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, you shall now go to Hell with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

O Eternity, Eternity! all of us here are ere long, it may be some of us within a few dayes or hours, to lanch forth into the Ocean of Eternity. Eternity is <hi>status interminabilis,</hi> sayes <hi>Boetius;</hi> no Prospective-glass can see to the end of Eternity. Eternity is a summe that can never be numbered, a Line that can never be measured; Eternity is a Condition of everlasting misery or everlasting happiness; if you are godly, then shall you be for ever happy, you shall be always sunning your selves in the light of Gods countenance; if you are wicked, you shall be always miserable, ever lying in the scalding Furnace of the wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Eternity to the Godly is a day that hath no sun-setting; Eternity to the Wicked is a night that hath no sun-rising. O I beseech you my Brethren, every day spend some time upon the thoughts of Eternity.

What is the World to him that hath Eternity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his Eye? Did we think seriously and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly of Eternity, we should never over-value the Comforts of the World, nor over-grieve the Crosses of the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We should not over-value the Comforts of the World. Worldly comforts are very sweet, but they are very swift, they are soon gone; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the World are but for a season; just like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove that brought an Olive branch in her Mouth, but she had Wings, and so did presently flie from the Ark; so are all outward Comforts, they bring an Olive branch, but they have wings too, with which they flie away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The thoughts of Eternity would make us not to over-grieve the Crosses and Sufferings of the World. What are these Sufferings to Eternity? our Sufferings, sayes the Apostle, are but for a while, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. What are all the Sufferings we can undergo in the World to Eternitie?

                  <p>THis General Doctrine I have already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto you from this Text, which indeed is the marrow and substance of the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That Gospel-believing is a Duty, which they that really perform are highly priviledged by to their greatest advantage: I have spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gospel-believing, and that it is a duty, and that they that do really perform it are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignified and priviledged by it, as hath been made to appear from the Chapter; that which remains to be done, and shall be, as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173109:26"/> the work of this morning, is, to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Doctrine, which is one of the most material and momentous Doctrines that can be preached to us. Gospel believing it hath most precious priviledges entailed upon it; whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, that Jesus is the Son of God, that Jesus is come in the Flesh, is born of God, knows God, and shall be eternally blessed of God, and with God; surely then the World runs upon a very great mistake. I have hinted something already to that purpose, but I have left the more full discussion and discovery of the matter until now. Why, who is there among the generality of common professors that is not very pregnant to hold forth this to be their faith? if so be that it should be put to the Question, Friend, what is your Faith, what Belief are you of? why not one in a thousand I think but will be apt to say, Why truly I will give you this Account, There is a Gospel which is preached among us, and in the World, and this Gospel doth hold forth this for true Doctrine, that Jesus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> that was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> is the Christ, is the Messiah which was promised by the Father, and which the World did live in expectation of so long; this Jesus I believe is the Son of God, this Jesus I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe is come in the Flesh, and he is come to be the Saviour of the World; this is the Belief, and that which is the common profession that is made by the generality of people. Why but will you consider now this Text, and other Scriptures do speak fully to this purpose, Whosoever doth believe this, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that he is come in the Flesh, whosoever
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173109:26"/> believes this is of God, is born of God. And it doth clearly appear, and may be most convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out, that many thousands that profess their belief concerning these things, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are not born of God. Why certainly there must needs be a great and gross fallacy in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; Gospel-faith and believing, it is not so common a thing as many take it to be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this be Gospel-faith, and that which doth interest Persons in such great and precious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, truly it concerns us to look well to it, that we be not mistaken concerning this Belief. Now this I would say, there is something in it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered with respect to the time wherein Christ appeared visibly to the World, and the after times wherein the Apostles did hold forth these great Doctrines of the Gospel concerning Christ. And this we are to say, that in such a time as that was when this was the Critical point as it were, the discriminating thing, in such a time for any to make this profession, and to hold forth this to be their Faith, and Belief, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, it was of high signification, and might very well, as to man, beget a comfortable confidence and hope concerning such persons, that certainly they were born of God, as to man, and according to rational Charity it might be very comfortable that such Persons as did thus believe, and profess this to be their Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, there were some blessed beam upon their Souls; for mark you, it hath been thus in the World, and among the people of it concerning matters of God and Godliness, that there hath been such and such a Truth, that hath been the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173109:27"/> Critical truth, as I said, that hath been, as I may so say, the <hi>Shiboleth</hi> whereby people are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished one from another. I allude to that passage in <hi>Judges</hi> concerning the <hi>Gileadites;</hi> they made a profession of themselves to be such and such, and they were put to it to pronounce <hi>Shiboleth;</hi> they that could not speak out the word, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce it, they were not judged to be the persons that they professed themselves to be; but they that could do it, held their liberty: so some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times such and such a Doctrine is ordered out to be a distinguishing point, upon the account of the desperate opposition that the World makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it; and upon this Account the Priests and the Rulers, and the rest of the world were despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately bent against Jesus; they called him Jesus, but could not endure him to be called Christ the Son of God; it was an Act and Decree amongst them, That whosoever should confess Jesus to be the Christ, should be put out of the Synagogue, should be excommunicated. Now for persons at such time, wherein it was as much as their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may be their Lives were worth, to own that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, for persons now at such a time to own this Jesus, that was in so mean a Condition, to be the Christ, there is very much in it, infinitely more than for persons now to take up this profession. Why? because this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath obtained in the World, and it is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine among Papists as well as Protestants; there is no such danger now for Persons to be of this Belief. But shall I say this, That for all that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this really according to the right account, and true genuine interpretation of Gospel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173109:27"/> the Case is the same with them and with us at this day, setting aside the consideration of times and time; the danger then, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement now; the Case is the same; Gospel-belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of these truths according to a genuine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Gospel-believing, it is the same now as then, and then as now: And therefore we must consider and look further.</p>
                  <p>I would put these few things to your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: You profess this to be your faith, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, that he is come in the flesh; these things you profess to believe, and if you do so indeed, you are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priviledged people, blessed of God, and shall be to all Eternity; but do you not mistake? Do you believe this, that Jesus is the Christ? How came you by this belief? What account can you give of it? How were you brought over to this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? Did you not come to this Faith and Belief by common report? You were born to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; You look upon it as that which is the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you have by your being born in a Nation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People that profess the Name of Christ, and this hath been instilled into you by educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and upon this account you take it: Did you ever buy this truth? It is a truth that Jesus is the Christ, how came it to be yours? Did you ever buy this truth? Buy it? I say buy it? For the very truth is, we are never able to make out a good Title to any Gospel-truth, until such time as we can say we have bought it: How? why, by serious meditation, studying the Scriptures, searching into them seriously, pondering and weighing of them, crying mightily to God, that he would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173109:28"/> them to us, and encountring temptations from without, from within; being at a point willing to engage liberty and estate, and life, and all for this truths sake: Can you say, We have pondered, and are so fully satisfied about it, as that if all the world should come in a way of contradiction, and rise up in opposition to us, and come with fire and sword to beat us out of this truth; yet we are resolved to stick to it? Can you give such an account of your selves, that you have not taken it up upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report, but are able to say there hath been an inward Revelation made of these things to your souls, that there hath been a sanctified work of the Spirit upon your understandings, that you come to see into the mystery of these Gospel-testimonies? Is there an habitual frame of Spirit wrought in you, whereby you are carried out to close with every truth of God, and to close with it upon this account, because of a divine authority stampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? when we give assent to common truths, but not with a common spirit, but in the strength of an inward conviction, we assent to it upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of an unction that we have received from the holy one; and we assent to this and that truth upon the account of a divine authority which we see to be stampt upon it, and withal we find that there are suitable workings of our heart in the loves and desires and delights of them to these truths (as there will be a kindly working of the heart where there is a right assent suitable to the truths assented to) as if there be a threatning, the Soul assents to it, and will tremble before God: If a promise be made, or a Gospel-revelation, it will be accompanied with a holy rejoycing in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173109:28"/> God, that ever he should make such a promise or Revelation; and then there will be a holy reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Spirit, Come what will come, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part with this truth; I have bought the truth, that was my duty; and having bought it, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sell it; that is my duty too; can we give such an account as this? but then withal let me a little further improve that which I have already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>You say this is your belief, That Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; but can you give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of those priviledges that are entailed upon this belief? for you must know that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which belong to such, will serve as eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that they are such.</p>
                  <p>Now if you believe, it is your priviledge to be born of God; and this being born of God must be the evidence of this belief. Can you give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your being born of God? If you are not born of God, you do not believe, That Jesus is the Christ. Can you give an account of your overcoming the World? Are you such as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to stand out in opposition to the errors, and heresies, and corrupt doctrines and practices that are in the world? Can you bear up against the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life? If you are in slavery to the world, in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the beggarly rudiments of the world, you are mistaken, That Jesus is the Christ: For he that believeth according to a true interpretation of Gospel-believing, That Jesus is the Christ, doth overcome the world, and by vertue of this belief he is enabled to get a conquest over the world and over the corruptions that are in it through lust.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:173109:29"/>
                  <p>And then again, You profess to believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is the Christ, the Son of God: Oh! but are you able to give an account that you have believed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Jesus, and upon this Jesus? for that is it the Text holds forth; He that believes that Jesus is the Christ, doth believe on Jesus the Christ; Are you by vertue of this believing which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, drawn out to a closing with Christ? do you roll your selves upon him? own him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Salvation, and are willing to yield your selves up in subjection to him? You believe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus to be the Christ; but do you believe on that Jesus whom you profess to be the Christ? Now this being thus laid down as a Foundation, I would infer thus, and so go on to a farther branch of this Application; Either you do really believe with a Gospel-believing these Truths and Doctrins concerning Christ, or you do not; Why, they that do profess they do, but in truth they do not, there is a clear and manifest contradiction which this profession meets withal, and that upon the accounts I have formerly given, as alas this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession suffers contradiction generally; generally the Professors of this Faith, that Jesus is the Christ, do clearly make a flat contradiction; and I am very confident that there are thousands, that if they should be put to the Tryal, Will you stick to this Truth? If you do, it shall cost you the loss of your Liberty, and Estates, nay, your Life shall go for it. Oh! I am very apt to think that you shall have thousands that will turn their backs upon this Profession, renounce this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Now concerning such, this I would say.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:173109:29"/>
                  <p>First, that the Condition of such persons as are not right in Gospel-believing is a most mournful &amp; miserable Condition; however it may be with them in other respects, yet it is sad to think what a Condition they are in; for consider first of all, they that do not perform this Great Duty of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-believing according to the truth and reality of it, I will tell you what they do, they do give God the lye, they do by interpretation tell God to his face, that he is a very Lyar; and what high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er blaspeming can there be then to give the lye to the God of Truth! every one will be apt to bless themselves, and say, Oh far be it from me, God forbid that I should be charged with such a horrid impiety as this! Oh but Brethren, the very truth is, it is a very common thing by interpretation to give the ly to God; &amp; al that do not believe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Gospel-believing that you have heard, do tell God to his face that he is a Lyar. How doth that appear? Why take a little help, such as I am able to give you; to profess that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, that he came to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, is ordered out to be our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, is sent of God to preach Liberty to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, to heal diseased Souls, and to deliver poor Creatures from the bondage of the Devil; those things People generally profess to believe; but mark you now, they never come to Christ, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver set in with him upon this account, and to this purpose, Oh Lord thou art the Jesus, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed of God; I come to thee for life, I am a poor dead Creature, I am in a state of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and thou art given to be for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Lord I fly to thee for it, I am a poor diseased
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173109:30"/> creature; the Plague is upon my soul, and thou art appointed to heal the Soul of the Plague; I come to thee for healing. There is not one of thousands that come thus to Christ. Will you now see how the lye is given to God? I profess for my part, saith one, I know no such matter; Jesus is the Christ, and I profess to believe so, and he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for such and such things; he is sent to preach liberty to the captives; I know not that there is any such bondage. Christ came to save sinners; alas I know no need of any such sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him; he came to heal diseased Souls; I am well enough, what need have I of Christ? what is this but to give the lye to God? He that receives not Christ, makes God a lyar; for he doth in effect say, Lord thou sayest so and so concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World; I know nothing of all this; and so the lye is given to God; And is it nothing to give the lye to the great God, the God of truth? And I tell you while you profess this Jesus to be the Christ, the Sonne of God, and in the mean time flye not to him; you believe him to be the Sonne of God, and that all Authority is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him, and you will not subject to his Authority, why you give the lye to God, and is this nothing?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider the sad condition of such as believe not according to a right Gospel-believing; they are such as are lyable to the dreadfullest touches from the Devil that possibly can be; He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth is born of God, overcomes the World, and is enabled to keep himself, that the wicked one doth not touch him with a mortiferous touch; but I tell thee whatever thou art, that art under the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173109:30"/> power of unbelief, thou art in danger of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful touch from the prince of darkness; and if thou livest and diest in a state of unbelief, thou wilt fall under the power of condemnation. I remember what our Saviour speaks, and consider well of it, <hi>You stand out in opposition to my Doctrine; but I tell you, Except you believe that I am he, you shall dye in your sinnes;</hi> a dreadful word, <hi>you shall dye in your sinnes,</hi> and what then, <hi>be damned eternally;</hi> this is the condition of all such as are in a state of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: but then on the other hand, in case we be able to give a good account of our believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Sonne of God, and of our believing on him concerning whom these Testimonies are given, Oh what cause have all such to rejoyce in their condition! the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such persons is happy beyond all expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and comprehension, that have owned these Truths, owned that Jesus of whom the faithful Testimonies are given.</p>
                  <p>Now all the Chapter, according to the account I have given you, comes in to the purpose of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and rejoycing the hearts of such Persons. Here is your comfort now; really believing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a right interpretation of Gospel-believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is your priviledge, you are the persons that are born from above, you are the persons that shall be enabled to overcome the World, to bear up against all opposition that men and Devils can make against you; you are the Persons that have the Witness within you, and you shall be able to bear up against all the contradictions of Sinners; you are the Persons that have Christ, and have eternal life by him; you shall have it, nay
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:173109:31"/> you have it already; <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath eternal life;</hi> he hath it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it, and shall have it in the compleat state of it; being brought over to Gospel-believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you may come with boldness to God in a way of prayer, with holy confidence that whatever else you ask believing, you shall have a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; God doth not neglect any believing prayer of a believing soul: And all the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Gospel are entailed upon you, and you are entitled unto them, and you shall have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them while you live, and when you die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Eternity; well it may be said of such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Blessed is he and she that hath believed with a Gospel-believing Gospel-Truths and Testimonies concerning Christ, and on Christ, on whom those Testimonies are given; for there shall be a full and perfect accomplishment of whatever God hath spoken with his mouth concerning such.</p>
                  <p>And then lastly, If the Grace of God hath brought us over to a closing with Christ, of whom these truths and testimonies are given; why the last branch of the Application is but this, That you would but justifie your believing, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to manifest the reality of your believing, accoding to the Gospel, by a suitable walking; this is that that shall be the closing up of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>

                     </gap>en, Let us consider well, our Saviour tells us in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>Wisdom is justified of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Why, if ever we mean to approve our selves to be Wisdoms Children, our care must be for to give in our Justification of Wisdoms sayings, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173109:31"/> for to carry it in a congruousness and suitableness unto that Gospel-believing which we profess to be by grace brought over to. Why, but what is that you will say? Why consider the Text, and see what remains of the Chapter. I shall make it out, give it up to you in this way:</p>
                  <p>Why, First of all this one special duty that lies upon you, That you would study your Mercy, and know what God hath been to you, and done for you, and how highly you are dignified, and not to be alwayes in a fluctuating state; and upon the questioning and disputing point; but to come to some well grounded confidence; that you may be able to say, We know that this and that is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and this and that is our dignified priviledge that we are planted under.</p>
                  <p>Do but mark how the point in hand doth charge this upon us, in the 13. verse of this Chapter, <hi>These things have I writ to you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have Eternal Life.</hi> Here is your duty according to what the Text it self doth charge upon you; if you be such as by grace are brought over to a Gospel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, the Apostle <hi>John</hi> that did write this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and I from it, preach unto you in the Name of the Lord, and by authority from him, that this is your duty, to know that you are persons that have Eternal Life, that you are such as Christ by his blood hath made a purchase of Eternal Life for; that he hath by his blood once for all entred into the holy place, that is not made with hands, that he might prepare for you, and that you might have the possession of those blessed mansions that he hath made preparation of.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:173109:32"/>
                  <p>Eternal Life it is yours, and you may be bold to claim it, and you are bound to hope and rejoyce in the expectation of the full enjoyment of it, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But then, a second thing that I have to charge upon you is this, That you would acknowledge with all thankfulness and enlargedness of heart, to God the riches of his mercy, and grace to you, that hath been pleased to cull you out of an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving world, and bring you over to the Gospel, and to the participations that are by Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Gospel: Oh! This you should set your hearts upon, by admiring the riches of Gods grace; and say, Lord, Why should'st thou mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest thy self to me, and not to the world! That many thousands should live and die in the total ignorance of Christ, and the Gospel-mysteries, or else live and die in an empty profession; and yet that God should be pleased to pitch upon me! This is that that the Text doth hint unto us in <hi>verse</hi> 19. of this Chapter. Oh! saith he in a triumphing manner, <hi>We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in wickedness:</hi> Oh! our mercies and the riches of grace that hath appeared to us, while the whole world that lies in wickedness, is put into the malignant one, lyes in the Devil, for he is the malignant evil one, while the whole world lyes in the Devil in malignity! Oh! It is a sad condition infinitely more sad then for a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173109:32"/> man to lye in the most noisomest stinking ditch, or in the loathsomest kennel; why this is that that heightens the mercy to poor souls that are called by grace according to the purpose of God, that while the whole world lyes in wickedness, and so are like to lye; yea, and to lye in hell to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that God should please to lay you in the bosom of his Son, and to take you into the arms of his mercy; this is that that should heighten our thankfulness. I may make use of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression which we find in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came unto a company of Heathens, and they saw what great things were done by them, and took notice of the gracious spirit that they discovered, sure say they, <hi>The Gods are come among us in the likeness of men.</hi> Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the state of times, and what a height of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness many at this day are grown up unto, the dreadful swearing, blaspheming of God and his ways: truly judge of it your selves, whether we may not say the devils are come among us in the likeness of men. Why now oh! How should we heighten our love and thankfulness to God, that should please in free grace to bring us over to close with Jesus Christ!</p>
                  <p>But then fourthly, as many as are brought over to <hi>Gospel-believing,</hi> this is your duty to study, and endeavour what you can your advantages in <hi>faith;</hi> and so the Apostle gives it in charge here in the Chapter in <hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>These things have I writ to you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the Son of God.</hi> This is that you should set about. If God hath brought you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173109:33"/> over to a closing with Christ, and an embracing of the testimonies concerning him, beleeve more and more, labour for your advancement, and let it be your Prayer, <hi>Good Lord encrease our faith:</hi> Labour that you may be clear in your apprehensions of Gospel-mysteries, and that you may be more strong in your adherence to Christ, of whom those Gospel-testimonies are given, and that you may not only come to have an adhering faith, but to an assuring faith; that you may not be like waves tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and tumbled up and down; but that you may come to be rooted and established, and grounded in your faith; that you may not come to be unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by heresie, corrupt Doctrines, or the Apostacy of others, but that you may be stedfast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</p>
                  <p>Yet further fifthly, This is to be given in charge to such as do believe according to the Gospel, that they carry it sutably to a believing state, as in those particulars that I have insisted upon, so in a deportment congruous and suitable to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which belong to believing: You are born of God; carry it as men and women that are so indeed: What! Born of God, the Sons and Daughters of God! What! and not live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God? and not study conformity to God? I remember what he speaks there concerning <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, How is it, that thou being the Kings Son, art lean from day to day?</hi> How is it, that we that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be the Sons and Daughters of God, are lean and lank, not more improved? that we do not shew forth God, and express Christ? This lies in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>If you be born of God, remember that you be born of him that is the God of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173109:33"/> Love;</hi> And therefore you are to manifest this birth and your believing, and your being born of God, by loving God, and by loving them that are born of God; <hi>He that believeth is born of God; and he that loveth him that begat, loveth him that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him.</hi> The God of Love doth beget a People of Love; a loving God, a loving People; And this is that that you should express your Believing by, and your Adoption by; by the Love you bear to God, and the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>A hateful spiteful spirit, where it doth discover it self, speaks those persons not to be born of God, but of the Devil; carry it as Believers, as persons of God, by studying a conformity to God, and by keeping his Commandments, subjecting your selves to his Authority; not living according to your own Lusts; but according to the Laws and Rules which God hath given you, saith the Apostle here, <hi>This is the Love of God, that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not a love in Word, and in Tongue, but in Reality; a love discovering it self by a conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care to hold conformity to all the Will of God; And if any should object, This is a hard saying, who can bear it? saith the Apostle, No such matter, there is never a Believing Soul will say the Commandements of Christ are grievous or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome; no, they are light to them that are brought over to the faith of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>And the last thing I have to charge upon you, upon the account of your Gospel-believing, and being brought over to a closing with Christ, it is this, and so upon the matter I have given you an account of the substance of this precious Chapter,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:173109:34"/> having reduced it to that general Doctrine I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded before: I say the last thing is this, That you would walk suitable to a believing state, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very careful concerning your Worships that you do perform, that they be according to God, and according to the Gospel; and this is that which the Apostle closes the Chapter withal in the 21 Verse, <hi>Little Children, keep your selves from Idols. Amen.</hi> As I take it, in the former Translation it was Babes, <hi>Babes, keep your selves from Idols;</hi> here it is <hi>Little Children.</hi> I observe in this Epistle the Apostle makes a distinction of Believers into three Ranks, as you shall find in the second chapter, <hi>I write unto you Little Children, I write unto you young men, and I write unto you Fathers;</hi> in the close of the Epistle, he concludes with this <hi>charge</hi> to <hi>Little Children;</hi> now whether he includes all the rest under this Title of <hi>Little Children,</hi> I forbear to dispute; but sure I am, it is a duty lies upon one and other, whether they be Babes or Young men, or Aged Fathers in Christ; Whatever our rank and condition be, I am sure of this, This is a great Duty that lies upon all that will approve themselves in Godliness, and to be brought over to the faith of the Gospel, that they look to their Worships, and that they take heed of Idols; as if he should say, He that is born of God, he keeps himself that the wicked One doth not touch him. Oh <hi>Little Children,</hi> shew forth that spiritual Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that by grace you are furnished withal, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to keep your selves from Idols.</p>
                  <p>It might be said, What is this to us? Are we in danger of Idols? True, well might the Apostle give in such a <hi>Charge</hi> to them in those times, when
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173109:34"/> the greatest part of the World were in a state of Heathenisme, and in estrangement from Christ, and the mysteries of the Gospel; But this I say, it doth really concern Christians in Gospel-times, that have had the breakings out of the Gospel-light, and the knowledge of Gospel-mysteries, to be careful of this <hi>Charge,</hi> that they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Idols; there were the Idols of the Heathens; grant it, and so still there are a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of People that our Souls should mourn over to consider their state, that are wrapt up in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, know nothing of the true God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and it is the state and condition of the Jews at this day; and what a sad condition are they in! Grant it that they do not worship Idols after the manner of the Heathens; yet they worship not the true God, because they worship not God in Christ: for saith the Apostle, <hi>Whoever sinnes, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, he hath not God; He that abides in the Doctrine of the Christ, he hath the Father and the Sonne:</hi> And so the Jewes at this day, they not abiding: not owning the Doctrine of Christ, they have not God, because they have not the Father and the Son; this is their condition: And thus I say, there were not only the Idols of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Oh! but sadly be it spoken, there are Idols among Persons pretending to Christ, and Gospel-faith, and the Doctrine concerning Grace by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
                  <p>How many Idols and Idolators are there? I might tell you the Covetous person is an Idolater, the Voluptuous person, and the Self-justitiary sets up his own Righteousness, and Idolizeth that:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:173109:35"/> But I say this, there are Idols among Christians; Papists hold forth the Name of Christ, but yet what woful Idolatry is there among them? There was the Dragon-worship in the time of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and in the room of that, there is come up the Beast-worship, and of that Worship the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the world runs upon; and it concerns us to keep from Popish Idolatry, it being the grossest Idolatry that ever was, because there is the fairest pretence of worshipping JESUS, and yet they turn him into an Idol. What else means their worshipping and bowing to Images, their breaden gods, and the like? Oh! therefore it concerns us to keep our selves from Idols; And there is a Scripture, if it were but well studied, would cause trembling of Heart, and make all that have any care of their Souls to look about them; that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture I refer you to, it is in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. compared with the 20th. In <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.11. whereas before there was Dragon-worship, it is said here, <hi>I beheld another Beast comming out of the Earth, and he had two Hornes like a Lambe, and he spake as a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and he exerciseth all the Power of the first Beast before him, and causeth the Earth, and them that dwell therein, to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed:</hi> now look at the 8. verse, saith he, <hi>And all the dwellers upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life, of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</hi> Oh! it is a terrible word, and that that should make us to fear and tremble, lest in any kind we should be drawn into the worship of the Beast; for as many as were not written in the book of Life of the Lamb, they were drawn in to the Worship of the Beast. This is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:173109:35"/> that that should make us keep our selves from Idols, from whatsoever hath but so much as a Tincture of Superstition and Idolatry; and the rather, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that other Scripture in the 20th. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the last verse, <hi>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of fire;</hi> All that are not written in the Lambs book of life, are prevailed to perform the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the Beast, and not being writ there, must be tumbled into the Lake for ever.</p>
                  <p>This therefore concerns us, to keep from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, from whatsoever hath a tendency that way, and that hath any tincture of Superstition upon it; and consider with your selves, that our Duty is in matters of Worship, and in things concerning the Worship of God, to see to it, that we keep a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dependance upon God, that we walk not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of men, but according to God; <hi>You were bought with a price, be not Servants of Men.</hi> We are to walk by a Line, by a Plummet, and what is not warranted by the word of God, or maintainable by Arguments drawn from it, we should not close with.</p>
                  <p>And for the closing up of all, do but consider how this chapter, and the things that I have spoken to you, and preached from it, how they do all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence this Exhortation, <hi>Little children, keep your selves from Idols;</hi> see to it, that you approve your selves in holy worship to God, and the Lord Jesus. Do but argue thus, You profess to be Believers; and is it not your duty to answer to this profession? Your Faith is a pure Faith, and an obediential Grace; it is a Grace that will tutor you to hang upon Christ, and his Appointments and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173109:36"/> And therefore being Believers, study to keep your selves from Idols, and whatever is not consonant to the will of God concerning Worship.</p>
                  <p>You believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; keep your selves from Idols in this respect; for he is come into the world, and hath shewed the pattern of his House; and then you are born of God; carry it like a people that are born of God, that are high born, and credit your holy Profession, by keeping a dependance upon that God of whom you are born: And then being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, you are born of God, and have overcome the world, and therefore shew forth your Heroick Spirit, by standing out in opposition to Idols, and whatever is contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of godliness.</p>
                  <p>You have an Unction from the Holy one, and this engages you to look to it, that you keep your selves from Idols; <hi>And then we know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the Sonne of God is come, and hath given us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true; even in his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> And thereupon he brings in this, <hi>Little children, keep your selves from Idols:</hi> as if he should say, This is the true God, God in Christ, Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, this is the true God, and he hath eternal life with him; other gods are false gods, and what benefit will you have by following them, and performing worship to them? Nothing but eternal death; false gods can bestow no eternal life upon you; but this is the true God, and he can give you eternal life; And therefore, <hi>Little children keep your selves from Idols.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:173109:36"/>
                  <p>And now yet one word more. I would not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion any discomposure of spirit that is not becoming you; But this I must say, for ought I know, you have the words of a Dying man, and we use to say, that the words of Dying men they are apt to take somewhat a deep impression; I mean a Dying man, not in properness of speech according to nature; and if it should be so, I hope there would be caufe of rejoycing on my part; But I speak the words of a Dying man in respect of Ministerial Office.</p>
                  <p>I suppose you all know there is an Act come forth by Supream Authority, and it is not for us to quarrel at all, but to submit to it, and hold correspondency with it so far as we can, with a good Conscience; and there being many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions that many, besides my self, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply withall, therefore we are willing to submit to the penalty inflicted.</p>
                  <p>This I say, you have for many years had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of my poor Labours; I have fulfilled near up towards 40 years, and have performed my service to God, Christ, and his People, and I blesse his Name, not without acceptance and success. My Work, so far as I know, in this course, as in the Weekly course, is now at an end; my Desire is, that you whose Hearts have been inclinable to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in the way of my Ministry, may be kept faithful to God, and that you may have the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the everlasting Covenant comming upon your Souls, and that you may have the power of this Doctrine, held forth in this Sermon, put forth upon your Hearts; that as you do believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173109:37"/> is the Christ, that Jesus is the Son of God, that as you profess these things, you may carry it suitably to your profession, that you may walk in Love to God, Love to Christ, and love to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; that you may labour to manifest a noble generous Spirit in overcoming the world in Errors, Corruptions, false Doctrines, and unwarrantable Worship; that you may in all things labour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your selves: <hi>And little Children keep your selves from Idols.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173109:38"/> righteous and the wicked; but there's a vast difference the one hath a reward of mercy, and the other a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Justice.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with the first of these, <hi>Say ye to the righteous, it shall be well with him.</hi> This Scripture was written in a very sad and calamitous time, as you may read in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>The mighty man, the man of war doth cease, the prudent and the ancient, both the Judge and the Prophet shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</hi> This was a very sad time with the Church of God in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> if the Judge be taken away, vvhere vvill there be any piety? and if the prophet be taken avvay; vvhere vvill there be any equity? the vvhole body Politick vvas novv running to ruin, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the rubbish: Novv in this sad juncture of time God vvould have this Text to be vvritten, and it is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks like a Rain-bow in the Clouds. God would have his people comforted in the midst of all these afflictions; <hi>Say ye to the righteous it shall be well with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proposition that lies in the vvords is this:</p>
                  <p>That hovvever things go in the World, <hi>It shall be well with the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is an Oracle from Gods ovvn mouth; and therefore vve are not to question or dispute it; <hi>Say ye to the righteous it shall be well with him I</hi> might mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Scriptures for the proof this, but I shall instance but in one, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Surely</hi> I <hi>know that it shall be well with them that fear God.</hi> It is a golden max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime to be disputed; I knovv it shall go vvell vvith them that fear God,</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:173109:38"/>
                  <p>For the illustration of this consider two things.</p>
                  <p>First, What is meant here by the <hi>righteous man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Why however things go, <hi>it shall be well with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Who is meant here by the <hi>righteous man.</hi> There is a Threefold righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>First, a legal righteousness, and so <hi>Adam</hi> in this sence was said to be righteous, when he did wear the robe of innocency; <hi>Adams</hi> heart did agree with the Law of God exactly, as a well made Dial goes with the Sun; but this righteousness is lost and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a Moral righteousnesse, and thus he is said to be righteous, that is, adorned with Moral Vertues, who is prudent, just, temperate, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is an Evangelical righteousnesse, and that is meant here; and this Evangelical righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is twofold: A righteousnesse by imputation, and a righteousnesse by implantation.</p>
                  <p>First, There is a righteousnesse by imputation, and that is, when Christs righteousnesse is made over to us; and this righteousnesse beloved, is as truly ours to justifie us, as it is Christs, to bestow upon us.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:173109:39"/>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a righteousnesse by implan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is nothing else but Gods infusing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f the seed and habits of grace into the heart, the planting of holinesse in a man, and making him p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aker of the divine nature: Now this is to be righteous in the sight af God, to have a righteousnesse of imputation, and a righteousnesse of implantation; and so much for the first thing.</p>
                  <p>The second thing is to shew you why however things go in the world, it shall be well with this righteous man; and it must needs be thus for tvvo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</p>
                  <p>First, Because he that is righteous, hath his greatest evil removed, his sinne is pardoned; and therefore it must needs be well with him. Sin is a thorn in a mans conscience; now when this thorn is pluckt out in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse and remission, then is it well with that man: Forgivenesse of sin, in Scripture, is called the lifting off of sin; so it is in the Hebrew in <hi>Job</hi> 7. <hi>Lord why dost thou not lift off my sin?</hi> It is a Metaphor taken from a weary man that goes under a burthen, ready to sink under it, and another mad comes and lifts off this burthen; so doth the great God, when the burthen of sin is ready to sink the conscience, God lifts ess this burthen from the conscience, and lays it upon Christs shoulders, and he carries it; now he that hath his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thus carried, it is vvell for him hovv ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hings go. Pardon and forgivenesse of sinne it is a c owning blessing, it is a jevvel in a believers crovvn: Pardon of sin is a multiplying mercy, it brings a great many
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173109:39"/> mercies along with it; whom God pardons he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopts; whom God pardons, he invests with holinesse and with glory. Pardon of sin is such a mercy that it is enough to make a sick man well, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.24. <hi>The inhabitants shall not say they are sick, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> The sense of pardon takes away the sense of pain; it must needs then be well with the righteous, his greatest evil is removed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How ever things go, <hi>it shall be well with the righteous,</hi> because God is his portion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16, 5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of my inheritance, the lines are fallen to me in pleasant places.</hi> In God all things a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to be found; and all that is in God, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for the good of the righteous; his power is his to help him; his wisdome is his to teach him; his spirit is his to sanctifie him; and his mercy is his to save him. God is the righteous mans portion; and can God give a greater gift to us, than to give us himself to us? God is a rich portion, the Angels riches; God is a safe and a sure portion, for his name is a strong tower; he is a portion that can never be spent, for he is infinitenesse; and he is a portion can never be lost, for he is Eternity; <hi>Thou art my portion for ever Psal.</hi> 73.26. And surely, it is well with them that have God for their portion: it is not well with them that are happy? why if God be our portion, we are happy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144.16. <hi>Happy is the people whose God is the Lord.</hi> And so much for the Doctrinal part.</p>
                  <p>The explication of this point may afford abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173109:40"/> of comfort to every godly man, to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son fearing God in this Congregation, God hath sent me this day with a Cowmission to comfort you, O that I might drop in the oil of gladnesse into every broken and troubled spirit; <hi>Say to the righteous it shall be well with him:</hi> Here's good news from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, however things are, yet still it is vvell with the righteous.</p>
                  <p>But here's a great question to be answered, How doth it appear that it is well with the righteous? for we often see it is worst with him; he is deprived of his comforts, he is made the reproach of the world for Christ, yea many times he loseth his life? how then is it well with the righteous?</p>
                  <p>I answer, yet still is it well with the righteous, though he meet with troubl in the world, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e wave riseth upon the neck of anoth r: yet is it well with the righteous, as appears in these following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>First, All the troubles that a righteous man meets with, turn to his good, and so it is well with him: That's a famous Scripture, <hi>Ier.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Whom I have sent out of this place, into the Land of the Chaldeans, for their good.</hi> Gods own Israel were transported into <hi>Babylon</hi> among their enemies, for their good. The troubles of the righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eous are onely a means o purge out their sins, and that's for their good, I have read a story of one <hi>Pereus,</hi> who r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nning at another with a sword to kill him, by accident the sword onely run into his impostume, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d broke that. Thus all the evils
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173109:40"/> and troubles of the righteous, do but serve to cure them of the imposthume of pride, and to make them more humble. When the body of a Saint is afflicted, his soul that revives and flourishes in grace; like two lawrel trees that <hi>I</hi> have read of, that when one wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other flourished; so wen the body is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet grace flourishes. God doth distill out of the bitterest drugs his glory and our salvation. That that the world looks upon as a punishment, that God makes medicinal, to heal the soul. Well then may it be well with the righteous; the rod of God upon a Saint, is but onely Gods pencil, whereby he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aws his image more lively upon the soul. God never stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the strings of his Viol, but to make the musick so much the sweeter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the midst of all the troubles that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal the righteous, yet still it is well with them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those inward heart-revivings that God gives them; we see a godly man in misery. but we see not his comforts; we see his prison grates, but we hear not that sweet musick that he enjoys in his conscience. God sweetens to his people outward troubles with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace. It is the title that is given to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. <hi>The God that comforteth them that are cast down.</hi> The bee can gather honey as well from the thistle and bitter he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b, as from the sweet flower: and a Child of God can gather joy out of his sorrow; out of the very carcasse sometimes he fetcheth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>When the body is in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in, the soul may be at ase as when a mans head akes, yet his heart may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173109:41"/> be well; Thus it is well with the Righteous, God g ves him inward comforts that revive him, and sweeten outward pain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In times of calamity and trouble, yet still is it well with the Righteous, because many times God hears his people in time of trouble; in a storm God will have a care of his Jewels, he will hide them, and suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>First, Many times God takes the Righteous by death in great mercy; he takes them away that they shall not see the miseries that are comming upon a Land; as <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> the Heathen Poet said, <hi>They were happy that dyed b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

You have a parallel Scripture to this. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. v. <hi>ult.</hi> it is spoken of <hi>Iosiah, I will gather thee to thy Fathers, thou shalt be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thy grave in peace, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ne eye shall not see the evil that I will bring upon this place.</hi> VVhy, <hi>Iosiah</hi> died in battel: How is it said then that he went to his grave in peace? the meaning is this, because <hi>Iosiah</hi> was an holy man, he had made his peace with God, and so went to his grave in peace; and because he should not see the evil approaching, therefore God gathered him to his grave in peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> speaks thus of <hi>Nepotian,</hi> it seems <hi>Ierome</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see some troubles before he died, meeting with some stormes; <hi>Now</hi> (said he) <hi>how happy is my friend</hi> Nepotian, <hi>that sees not these troubles? happy is he that is gotten out of the storm, and is in the haven.</hi>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Luther</hi> died in mercie before the troblos of <hi>Germany</hi> begin to break forth. Thus it is well with the Righteous, though they do die; God takes them away in mercie, that they may not see approaching evils.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though the righteous doe die, are taken away, and perish in a storme, yet is i: well with them, because death cannot hurt them; it can neither hurt their Bodies, nor yet their Souls; the Bodie is safe, it doth not perish, though it doth die; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints are verie precious dust in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; the Lord locks up these Jewels in the grave, as in a Cabinet; the bodies of the Saints lie mellovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ripening in the grave, till a blessed time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: How precious is the dust of a Belieber! though the World minde it not, yet it's precious to God.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173109:42"/> righteous in their bodies; they shall not perish.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, At death it shall be well with the righteous, as to their souls. O it it shall be a blessed time; Methinks it is with a Saint at the time of death just as it was with <hi>Paul</hi> in his voyage to <hi>Rome;</hi> the ship did break into many peices, but yet he got safe to shore; so it is with a believer, though the ship of his body may be snapr and broken at death; yet the passenger is safe, the soul gets safe to sho re even to the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> then surely it is well with the righteous at his death; the day of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers dearh is the birth-day of his blesssdnesse? it is his ascension day to heaven; his death day is his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage day with Jesus Christ; faith doth but contract us here, but at death the Nuptials shall be solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized in glory; and shall it not be well with the righteous? they shall see God face to face: And says <hi>Austin, Ipse Deus sufficit ad praemium.</hi> It will be heaven enough to have the sight of God. The Saints shall then entert into joy; joy now enters into them here, but then they shall enter into joy; they shall drink of that pure river that runs from God the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fountain.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see it shall go well wirh the righteous however things go, though troubles come, though death it self come; and therefore let those that are the people of God comfort themselves with these words.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this first point, what encouragement is this to all you that hear me now, to begin to be righteous! This Text may tempt us all to be godly,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173109:43"/>
                     <hi>Say to the righteous it shall be well with him;</hi> when things go never so ill with him; yet still it shall be well with him: Grant that all things are ill with you in your estate, in your relations, yet then if you are righteous, all things shall be well with you, your pardon is sealed, you are an Heir of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, all things shall work for your good; you have God for your Father, you have heaven in reversion for your inheritance; and is it not well with you? how may this make us all in love with godlinesse, how may this tempt us to be godly? for if ever we would enjoy happinesse, we must espouse holinesse; <hi>Say to the righteous it shall be well with him.</hi> And so much for the first proposition.

                  <p>Now if this will not prevail with men to make them leave their sins and become righteous, I must pass in a few words to the next b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That when things seem to be well with wicked men, it shall be ill with them at last.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now that I may a little clear this to you, I shall demonstrate it to you in these following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:
<list>
                        <item>1. It is ill with the Wicked in this life.</item>
                        <item>2. It is ill with him at his death.</item>
                        <item>3. It is ill with him at the day of Judgement.</item>
                        <item>4. It is ill with him after the day of Judgement.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, It is ill with the Wicked in this life. There's hardly a wicked man that hears me, that thinks so, when he hath the affluence and confluence of outward comforts, when he eats of the fat, and drinks of the sweet, he will hardly believe that Minister that tells him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> shall be ill with him; yea but it is ill with the Wick d even in this life; for is it not ill with that man that hath a curse, yea the curse of God entailed upon him? My <hi>Text</hi> pronounceth a curse against the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Vae improbo, Wo to the wicked:</hi> And can that man thrive that lives under a Curse? Clouds of blood and wrath hang over the head of a wicked man; he is heir to all the plagues that are written in the book
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173109:44"/> of God; all Gods curses are the Sinners portion, and if he dies in his sinnes, he is sure to have the portion paid him. Woe to the Wicked; everie bit of Bread he eateth he hath it with a curse, like poysoned Bread gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Dogge; everie drop of VVine he drinks, he swallowes down a curse with it. Woe to the Wicked, there is a curse in his Cup, there is a curse on his Table, God hath said, VVoe to him.</p>
                  <p>We read of <hi>Belshazar, Dan.</hi> 5.4.5. that <hi>when he tasted the wine; he commanded to bring the gold and silver taken out of the Temple; then they brought the gold and silver vessels, and drank wine, and praysed the gods of gold and silver.</hi> He was very jovial, but in the midst of his cups and jollity, woe to the VVicked; for in the same hour there came forth the fingers of a Mans hand, ann wrote over against the Candlestick on the VVall a Curse and VVoe. Woe to the Wicked; let a sinner l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ve till he be a hundred years old, yet still he is accursed, <hi>Esay</hi> 23.20. <hi>Though a sinner live a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old, yet shall he dye accursed; his grey hairs have a curse upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It shall be ill with the Wicked at the hour of death, and that in two respects; Death puts an end to all his comforts, and Death is a beginning of all his miseries.</p>
                  <p>First, Death puts an end to a Sinners comforts. There shall be no more indulging of the Flesh, and pampering of it; no more cups of VVine, and no more Musick to be seen or heard then. In <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. <hi>The things that thy Soul lusteth after is departed from thee; the voyce of the Harpers, Musicians and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:173109:44"/> Trumpeters shall be no more at all in thee;</hi> it is spoken of the destruction of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus may it be said of a wicked man at death, All joy and pleasure is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thee; no more shalt thou hear the voyce of the Harp; Organ or Trumpet: no more shall the Sinner be cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>athed in Scarlet robes, or adorned with sparkling Diamonds; Now all oyle and balsome, all joy and gladness, at death shall cease and depart from the Sinner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As Death puts a period to a Sinners mirth, so it layes a foundation for all his sorrowes. Usually before Death doth close the eye of the Sinners body, the eye of his Conscience is first opened.</p>
                  <p>Every sinne at the hour of death stands with a draws sword in his hand; Those sinnes that delighted the Sinner formerly, now terrifie and affright him. All his joy vnd mirth is turned into sadnesse.</p>
                  <p>As sometimes you have seen Sugar lying in a damp place, dissolve and turn to Water: Thus all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>row.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It shall be ill with a Wicked man at the day of Judgement, when he is cited before Gods Tribunal, when he shall leave courting his VVickednesse, and stand at Gods Barr to answer for it.</p>
                  <p>You r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad of <hi>Faelix,</hi> that when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> speak of Judgement, <hi>Faelix</hi> trembled. <hi>Iosephus</hi> observed that <hi>Faelix</hi> was a wicked man; and she that then lived with him, her name was <hi>Drusilla,</hi> whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173109:45"/> away from her Husband, and lived in sinne with her; Now when <hi>Faelix</hi> heard <hi>Paul</hi> speak of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he trembled, his Conscience that check'd him for his sinne.</p>
                  <p>Now, if <hi>Faelix</hi> trembled at the hearing of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what will Sinners do when the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall come, when all mens secret sins shall be made manifest, when all their midnight wickednesse shall be written upon their Foreheads as with the point of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond?</p>
                  <p>At the day of Judgement, my Beloved, there will be two things:
<list>
                        <item>First, The Legal Tryal.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, The Sentence.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, The Legal Tryal. God will call forth Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Name, and say, Stand forth, Hear thy Charge, Let me see what thou canst answer to to it? VVhat canst thou say for all thy Sabboth-breaking? for all thy Drunkennesse and Perjury? for all thy Revenge and Malice? for all thy persecuting of my Members? what canst thou say for all these? Guilty or not guilty? Thou Wretch darest not say Not Guilty; for have not I been an eye witnesse of all thy Wickednesse? do not the Books agree, the Book of thy Conscience, and the Book of my Omnisciency? and canst thou plead Not guilty? Here the Sinner will be amazed with horrour, and run into desperation.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:173109:45"/>
                  <p>Secondly, After this legal Tryal follows the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Ite Maledicti,</hi> Go ye cursed; What go from the presence of Christ, in whose presence there is fulness of joy, and go from Christ with a curse! That word <hi>depart,</hi> said Saint <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> is worse than the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themselves.</p>
                  <p>And Beloved, remember this ye that go on in a sinne, when once the Sentence is past, it can never be reversed; This is the most Supreme Court of Judicature, from whence there is no Appeal. Here on Earth men can remove their Cause from one Court to another, from the Common law to the Chancery; but if once the Sentence be past at this Judgement ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving your Cause. This is the highest Court, there is no appealing any where else. And thus you see it is ill with the Wicked at the day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It shall be ill with the Wicked after the day of Judgment. Oh! then there is but one way, and they would be glad if they might not go that way; But they must go that way even to prison, yea to hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23, 24. <hi>In Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> Hell is the very center of Misery, the spirit of torments stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture tells us in Hell there are three things:
<list>
                        <item>First, Darknesse.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, Fire.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, Chaines.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:173109:46"/>
                  <p>First, Hell is called a place of Darknesse. In <hi>Iude</hi> Verse 13. <hi>To them is reserved the blacknesse of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for ever.</hi> Darknesse you know is the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable thing in the world: A man that goes in the dark trembles every step that he goes; Hell is a black Region; There is nothing but darknesse of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; It must needs be a da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k place, where there shall be a separation from the light of Gods presence. Indeed <hi>Austin</hi> thinks, that there shall be some little sulphureous light: But suppose there be; that light shall onely serve the damned to behold the tragedie of their own miserie, to see themselves tormented.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In Hell there is Fire; it is called a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lake, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Whosoever was not found written in the book of Life, was cast into the lake of fire.</hi> You know the Fire is the most torturing Element; it makes the most dreadfull impression upon the Flesh. Why Hell is a place of Fire; it is disputed among some of the learned what kind of fire it is; I wish we may never feel what kind of fire it is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Austin, Peter Lumbard,</hi> and others affirm. That it is a material Fire, but far hotter than any culinarie fire; the fire on your hearths is but painted fire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this. But I rather think, the fire of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is partly material, and partly spiritual. Partly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, to work upon the body; and partly spiritual; which is the wrath of God to torment the Soul: This is that Lake of burning fire; Oh! who knows the power of Gods anger? who can dwell with these burnings? It is intolerable to hear these scorchings, and it is impossible for the damned to escape them.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:173109:46"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, In Hell there are Chains of darknesse; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the 6th. Verse of the Epistle of <hi>Iude, Those sinners that would not be bound by any law of God, shall have chains of darkness to bind them.</hi> But what is the meaning of this phrase, <hi>chains of darkness?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I suppose it may be this, to intimate to us, That the Wicked in Hell shall not have power to walk up and down; which perhaps would be a little ease to them, though a very little; yea but they shall not have so much as that little ease, but shall be chained, tyed, and staked fast with chains of darkness, that they shall not stirre; and this is very terrible.</p>
                  <p>Suppose a man did alvvayes lye upon a dovvn-bed, if he might not stirre off the place, it vvould be very painfull to him, though on a bed of dovvn; Hovv terrible then will it be to the damned, that must lie under the scorchings of Gods fury, chained dovvn, and not be able to move? And thus shall it be to the Wicked.</p>
                  <p>And to adde to the torments of Hell, there are two things vvhich shevv it shall be ill vvith the vvicked, let them dye when they vvill.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First, There is the Worme.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, There is the Serpent.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>First, There is the Worme to torture the Spirit, <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nd this is no other but the worme of Conscience, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.44. <hi>VVhere their worm never dyes;</hi> Hovv dreadfull will it be to have this Worme gnawing continually! <hi>Melancthon</hi> called it a hellish fury. Conscience will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173109:47"/> be just as if a worm full of poyson were gnawing the heart of a man; Those sinners that would never hear the voice of Conscience, shall for ever feel the worme of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is the Serpent, and that the Devil called the old Serpent, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. As there is the biting of the Worme, so there is the stinging of the Serpent. The damned in Hell shall be forced to behold rhe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that damned Monster. I remember what <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> saith, <hi>I had rather endure all the torments of this life, than see the Devil with bodily eyes;</hi> But this sight of the Devil the Wicked shall see whether they will or no; and not onely see, but shall feel the sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this old Serpent.</p>
                  <p>Sathan is full of rage against Mankind, and he will shew no mercy;: as he puts forth all his subtilty in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men, so he puts forth all his cruelty in tormenting men.</p>
                  <p>And this is not all; there are two things more that aggravate the torments of hell, to shew that it shall be ill with the wicked.</p>
                  <p>First, These agonies, these hell-convulsions shall be for ever, <hi>Revelr</hi> 14.11. <hi>The smoak of their torment ascended for ever and ever, and they shall have no rest day nor night.</hi> Thus is it in Hell; they would die, but they cannot; <hi>mors sine morte,</hi> the wicked shall be alwayes dying, yet never dead; alwayes consuming, yet never consumed; <hi>the smoak of their furnace ascends for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh! who can endure thus to be for ever on the wrack; this wotd <hi>Ever</hi> breaks the heart of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173109:47"/> they now think a Sabbath long, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon long; and a prayer long; they cry out, When will these be over! Oh! how long then will it be to lie in Hell torments for ever and ever? After the wicked have lain three millions of years, their torments will be as far from ending as they were the first hour they came there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The damned in Hell shall have none to pity them. It is some com frt and ease to have friends pity us when we are on our sick beds, or under any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl ction: but the damned shall have none to pity them; M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rcy will not pity them; that is turned to fury; Christ will not pity them, he is no more an Advocate for them; Angels will dot pity them, for they rejoyce to see the vengeance, they insult and glory to see the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God executed upon them. Oh! how sad is it to lie in the scalding furnace of Gods wrath, and to have none to pity us? Gods bowels will be locked up, and his heart will be hardened to damned sinners; then they shall call and God will laugh at them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. I <hi>will laugh at your calamity.</hi> Hear this all you that go on in sin, <hi>it will be ill with the wicked;</hi> O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>turn from your sins, least God tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver, or help you.</hi>

                     </gap> a confounding word is this to all the Wicked, that go on desperately in sinne? that adde drunkennesse to thirst? Never was there such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of wickednesse, as there is now adayes: Men sinne, as if they would sinne to spight God; as if they would dare Heaven to punish them:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173109:48"/> men sinne so greedily, às if they were afraid Hell gate would be shut up ere they could get thither. How many are there that sinne manfully? that go to Hell stoutly in their wickedness? as <hi>Seneca</hi> speaks. These are in a sad condition. Remember what the text saith, <hi>VVo to the wicked, it shall be ill with them;</hi> ill with them in life, in death, and after death. A wicked man lives cursed, and dyes damned. Sinners are Gods standing mark that he shoots at, and he never misseth the mark. You know what the Scripture sayth, <hi>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a saying of <hi>Latimer,</hi> that is very sad fare, where weeping is the first course, and gnashing of teeth is the second.</p>
                  <p>But whence may this gnashing of the teeth come?</p>
                  <p>First, It ariseth from the extremitie of the torments that the damne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, The Wicked gnash their teeth out of envy, to think that the godly are happy and blessed; those that they reproaehed, hated and persecuted, they are happy in glory, and they themselves are thrown down into Hell; this cuts them to the heart to think of it, and makes them gnash their teeth, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of God, and you your selves thrust out.</hi> And this is the first use shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:173109:48"/>
                  <p>Secondly, take heed that none of you are here found in the number of the Wicked; take heed of being of this black Regiment; beware of the Devils colours; fight not under his Banner; it shall be ill vvith the Wicked; the Sinner and the Furnace shall never be parted.</p>
                  <p>In a word, I beseech you take heed of those sinnes that bring to Hell fire: There are, said Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> fiery sinnes that bring men to Hell fire. What are these fiery sinnes? Why they are the fire of Malice, the fire of Passion, the fire of Lust, the fire of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, and the fire of Revenge: these fiery sins bring men to fiery plagues, to Hell fire. When you are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any sinne, think with your selves, How can I bear the lying in the fierceness of the Wine-press of Gods wrath for ever!</p>
                  <p>I have read a story of a Virgin, that being tempted by a young man to commit folly, sayes she to him, If you will grant me but one request, I will do what you desire. What is that? said he. Why, do but hold your Finger one hour in this burning Candle. No, he would not do that: said she to him, Will not you for my sake hold your Finger one hour in the Candle, and would you have me lay my Soul burning in Hell for ever, for the satisfying of your Lust? And thus she refuted that temptation.</p>
                  <p>Why doth Sathan tempt you to Wickednesse? hold up this Text agaiast the Devil, as a shield to quench his fiery darts; Sathan, it will go ill with the wicked; If I embrace thy temptation, I must be under thy torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:173109:49"/>
                  <p>O therefore learn to be Righteous: it shall be well with the Righteous; take heed of living and dying in sinne: It shall be ill with the VVicked; the God of Heaven hath said it.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude all with a saying of <hi>Austine;</hi> sayes he, <hi>When a man hath been vertuous, the labour is gone, and the joy remains: when a man hath been wicked, the pleasure is gone, and the sting remaineth.</hi>

                  <p>THese are the words of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are spoken by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and they are spoken of himself; though yet in a sober and modest sence they are applicable to all his members: That which Christ here affirms, is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173109:50"/> that the presence of God was alwayes with him; and this is first propounded, <hi>He that sent me is with me:</hi> and then it is amplified, <hi>and the father hath not left me alone:</hi> and then thirdly the reason of this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, <hi>for I alwayes do those things that please him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall speak but very little of the words as they do refer to Christ; he tels us where his Father was with him; he did not leave him alone in all the troubles and difficulties that he met withal in the finishing the great work of mans redemption; still God was with him: It is true, there was a time when Christ was without the sensible manifestation of his Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Why but yet even then in truth and in reality his Father did not leave him; for though he had not the evidences of his Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, yet he had the influences of his fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. It would take up much time to shew you how in all particulars the Father was present with Christ: I will onely speak this one word, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this one thing; Gods assisting presence was alwayes with him, both in his active, and also in his passive obedience; and indeed he had that work to do, and those miseries to suffer, that if God had left him, if he had not been mightily assisted by the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Christ as meer man could neither have done, nor have suffered what he did; but the Father was with him, and to support him; <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom</hi> I <hi>uphold.</hi> You shall find that Christ did act faith upon this; in <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.7. <hi>The Lord God will help me, therefore shall</hi> I <hi>not be confounded.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>The Lord will help me.</hi> So to the same effect is

                     </gap>st place, Afrer he had been engaged in that Combat with Satan, you read of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. the strongest Combat or Duel that ever was fought; wherein you have the Prince of Peace and the prince of darknesse; the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the roaring Lion that seeks how to devour; both of them putting forth their utmost strength, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to overcome each the other: Now I say in this Combat the Father did not leave Christ, but he helps him; for he sends an Angel for to minister unto him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.11.</p>
                  <p>So in Christs bitter Agony in the Garden, just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his bitter passion and death upon the Crosse, the Father did not leave him alone, for he sent an Angel unto him to strengthen him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.43. and so in several other places, and in several other things I might instance; but I shall passe this by. I but now, Why did the Father thus stand by Christ? he gives you the reason of it in the Text, because he alwayes did the things that pleased him: This I shall open in a double respect.</p>
                  <p>First, Christs undertaking of the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, it was very well pleasing unto his Father, that poor lost undone sinners should be brought back again unto God, and restored unto his love and favour: I say, the Father was infinitely well pleased with Christ <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> the world to enter upon this great work, the Father sends him out with this witnesse, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom, I am well pleased.</hi> He speaks not of his well pleasing only to his person, but also to his well pleasing as unto his undertaking.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As rhe work it self was pleasing unto God, so Christs managing of this work was all along pleasing unto his Father: and that doth appear in this, that Christ in all things kept to his Fathers Commission, and to his Fathers Command: I say in all things he kept to his Fathers Commssion; he did nothing here upon Earth, but what was within the compasse of his Commission; for saith he in the verse before the Text, <hi>I do nothing of my self, but as my Father bids me.</hi> So also he acted in conformitie to his Fathers will; that was the rule and square by which Christ ordered all his actions; his eyes was still upon his Fathers will; whatever he willed him to do, that he did; whatever he willed him to suffer, rhat he suffered; and thus he alwayes did the things that were pleasing to his Father; but I do not intend further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words in this reference; For my designe is to bring down the words unto our selves, to those that are the members of Christ; for there is th<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kenesse unto Christ; as you know there is a blessed resemblance and similitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and his members; they have the same spirit that Christ had, onely in a different proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he had it without measure; they have the same grace as Christ had for substance, though not for degree; of his fulness we all have received grace for grace; that is, as many interpret it, grace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable unto grace: As the print in the wax an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the print in the Seal; and as face answers to face; so grace in believers answers unto that grace that was in Christ: They are to shew forth the vertues of Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Now this was the grace and vertue and holinesse of Christ, that he alwayes did the things that pleased his Father.</hi> Why this is in all believers, onely with turs difference; it was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al performance in the one, it is but indeavour in the other; it was perfect in the one; it is sincere, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in the other.</p>
                  <p>Christ alwayes did the things that pleased God; a believer endeavours alwayes to do the things that please G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d; he doth not alwayes do so; witness <hi>David</hi> in the Case of his uncleanness, when he displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord, as it is in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>The Observation I intend to speak to, shall be this:</p>
                  <p>They that please God; and endeavour alwayes to do the things that please God, such God will be with; such the Father will not leave alone; especially in times of suffering and trouble; for I will bring it to that Case.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:173109:52"/>
                  <p>Indeed God will not leave such at any time; for that promise is exceeding full, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. I <hi>will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> I do not know any one promise in all the Bible, that is exprest with such an Emphasis as that promise is; such a multiplication of negatives in the Original. But especially God will not leave such in an afflicted and suffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>In the prosecuting of this I will speak to four things:</p>
                  <p>First, I will shew you when a man may be said to do the things that please God. 2. I will confirm the truth of the Doctrine. 3. I will shew you in what respects God will be with them that desire to please him, in a suffering condition. 4. I will give you the grounds and reasons of it; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d then I shall come to an Application.</p>
                  <p>For the first, We please God in what we do, when we act, 1. In a suitablenesse to Gods nature: And 2. In subjection to Gods Law: For pleasing of God lies in these two things. As that pleases a man which is suitable to his disposition, and is correspondent with his Command: We do the things that please God, when we do that which God doth; and when we do that which God commands: When we hate sin, as God hates sin; when we are holy, as God is holy. You shall find it in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That you may walk worthy of God, unto all well-pleasing.</hi> Observe, This walking worthy of God, is walking suitably, or walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answerably to God. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Bring foth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173109:52"/> fruit worthy of repentance;</hi> or bring forth fruit answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to repentance; so to walke worthy of God, is to walk suitable to God, to his nature: Now then observe what follows, that you might walk worthy of God to all well pleasing; then we please God, when we walk suitably unto God: So also when we act in a blessed conformity to God, to his Law; for nothing can please the good God, but what is good: Now the Law being the measure and standard of all goodnesse, nothing can be good, but what bears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to this Law, which is the will of God. God is well pleased when his will is observed: As you know, you that are Masters, your servants please you when they doe your will. That inference of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle for this is very apposite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>So then, they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</hi> VVhat is this same inference grounded upon? because the carnal mind is enmitie against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can; so that they that are in the flesh cannot please God. Why? Because there is that principle in them, as carries out a real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to the Law and Will of God; it is as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had said, They will not be subject to Gods will, not obedient to Gods commands; there is a principle of enmitie in them against these things, and so cannot plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e God: God is pleased when his will is fulfilled, and his commands observed; to please God, is in all things so to act, that whatever we do, we may expresse a likenesse to Gods nature, and a blessed subjection to Gods revealed will, and this is the first thing.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:173109:53"/>
                  <p>A second thing is the proof of the Doctrine; they that thus please God, he will be with them, he will not leave them alone; especially in an hour of trial: For my brethren, assure your selves of this, that which the Father did for Christ, he will do for all his members; it is true, Christs sufferings, being greater than ours possibly can be, and so his relation to God being higher than ours is; he a Son by eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we onely by Adoption; he had the presence of God in a more glorious manner then we can expect; but yet in our Sphere according to the measure of our trial, and according to our capacity, we shall as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the presence of God with us, as Christ had with him; that as we are partakers of Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, so we also shall be partakers of Christs support; He that will be present with believers in heaven, as he is with Christ, he will be present with believers here on earth, as he was with Christ in all his sorrows and sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Now for the confirming of this comfortable truth, I need not speak much: Many promises you have in Scripture for it, and whatever God hath promised, he will certainly make good: Turn to that one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise instead of many, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>VVhen thou pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest through the water,</hi> I <hi>will be with thee; through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> And you shall find too that the Saints hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> experienced it in all ages, God hath made it good.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:173109:53"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> was a man that met with many sharp trials, God execrcised him with many troubles; you shall find that when he was going to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> and was in a very afflicted condition, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.15. God comes unto him, and saith, <hi>Behold, I am with thee, Gen.</hi> 31.5. His father frowned upon him, but the God of his fathers helped him: <hi>Joseph, Gen.</hi> 29.20. His master took him, put him into prison, a place where the Kings prisoners were bound; he was in the prison, but the Lord was with <hi>Joseph.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dungeon, but the Scripture saith, <hi>God was with him.</hi> The three Children were thrown into the Furnace of fire, but there was a fourth with them, and that was the Son of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was brought to his trial, all men forsook him, but God stood by him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. So the Christians in all their sharp sufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. they were persecuted, but not forsaken; persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, but not forsaken by God. God hath abundantly made out this, and doth so still, that he will never leave those alone in a time of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who desire unfeignedly in all things to please God.</p>
                  <p>Now the third thing is to shew you in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects God is with such: why this presence of God is an active presence: God is not meerly with his people, but he is with them in an active way: for this is a certain truth, God is working when the Saints are suffering, I will open this in several particulars.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:173109:54"/>
                  <p>First, God is with such in his teaching pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Gods correction, and Gods instruction they usually go together; and where there is the chastenings of Gods hand, there is also the teaching of Gods Spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.12. <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chastnest, and whom thou teachest.</hi> Christ, though he were a Son, yet learn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed obedience by the things that he suffered: God teacheth his upright ones many lessons in a time of adversity, which they never learned in a time of prosperity. For we are like idle boyes, or bad Schollers, that learn best when the rod is over us: In a prosperous condition God speaks to us, and we mind him not, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 2.21. <hi>I spoke to thee in thy prosperity, but thou wouldest not hear:</hi> and this hath been thy manner from thy youth upwards: In prosperity God speaks once and twice, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, but we will not hear; but in the time of adversity God opens the ears: <hi>Judges</hi> 8.16. As <hi>Guidean</hi> taught the men of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth</hi> with thornes and briars: so doth God teach his people by affliction: and oh the many blessed truths that they learn, when they are under the rod, when they want liberty! Oh what a mercy is it to have liberty then, when they have not Ordinances as before! what a mercy is it to have Ordinances then! Oh what an evil thing is it then for them, that they have departed from God! God teaches them these things then: sin is never so bitter, mercy is never so sweet, as in a time of suffering: Oh how vain and empty is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then! Oh how sweet is communion with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:173109:54"/> God then! I say such things as these God teaches then.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is with such in his guiding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, and afterwards receive me unto glory.</hi> When <hi>Israel</hi> was in the Wilderness, then they had the cloud to guide them. It is a blessed thing to live under the conduct and direction of the wise God: we never have so much of this as in an hour of travel: indeed the people of God never flie so much to God for direction as at such a time: as <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was in distress, then he calls for the Ephod, and thus it is with us under affliction, then we look to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God is with them in his preserving and hiding presence: God is the Saints hiding place, their Shield, their Buckler, their Rock, their Defence: the Scripture-expressions are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to hold out Gods protection as to his people: God hath a constant care over them to preserve them and save them; oh but especially in a time of trouble: as the Mariner is never so careful of the ship as under a storm; and God is never so careful of his Church and people as under affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Jeremy</hi> is in the Dungeon, now God saves him: <hi>Daniel</hi> is in the Den, now God saves him: The three Children in the Fire, now God saves them: <hi>Peter</hi> is in prison, now God saves him: The Mother never tends the Child so carefully, as when the child is sick; and Providence is never
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173109:55"/> so tender to the people of God, as under a suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God is with them in his comforting presence: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation:</hi> and usually we have most of consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, when we have most of tribulation from without: as our sufferings do abound, so our consolation doth abound much more: The Child that is beaten when it is well, is cherished when it is ill: when persons are sick, then you give them cordials: God gives the best of comforts in the worst of times: when the burden is heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the back, then the peace of conscience is great within: the worse it is without, the better it is within: when men discover most of anger, then God discovers most of love.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God is with such in his strengthning presence, to enable them, and to support them to undergo whatever he is pleased to call them unto: this is the way of our good and gracious God, he alwayes gives out strength as he layes on affliction: he never leaves his Children alone in this respect: he will be with them to support them: though it may be not to deliver, yet he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l certainly be with them to support; the rod and the staff they go together, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23.4. the afflicting rod, and the supporting staff: when one hand is upon the Saint to afflict, then the other hand is underneat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Saint to support: <hi>Isay</hi> 41.10. <hi>I will uphol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thee, I will strengthen thee; fear not, I will help thee,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173109:55"/> yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> found,, <hi>I cryed unto the Lord in my distress, he answered me, and strengthned me in my inward man, Psal.</hi> 138.3. Oh when men afflict, God supports: when men put the Children of God into deep waters, then God takes them by the chin, and holds them up, that they shall not sink and be drowned.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God is with them in his sympathizing presence: Oh he hath a tender sence of all the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and calamities of his people! Oh it grieves him when they are grieved! they that tonch them, tough the apple of his eye: in all their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he is afflicted, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why persecutest thou me?</hi> Every blow that is given to them, God bears a part of it himself: as they are sensible of Gods dishonour, so God is sensible of their sufferings; it pains him to the heart to see his Children wronged and abused by a malicious world.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He is with them by his sanctifying presence: all their troubles are to do them good, and to make them good: and therefore the furnace it is but to refine them from their dross: the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hook of affliction it is but to cut off their luxuriant branches: God takes the sharp knife into his hand and lances them, but it is only to fetch out their corruption: by this shall the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Jacob</hi> be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:173109:56"/>
                  <p>Eighthly, God is with them by his quickning presence, to make their Prayers more fervent, to make their requests to the Throne of Grace more importunate. The children of God cry most to him when they suffer most from men, and their prayers are best when their condition is worst: Prayer shortens affliction, and affliction heightens Prayer: God is with them to hear their prayers. Oh the Prayer of the afflicted that comes up to Heaven! God hears the sighs and groans of his oppressed ones, their tears pierce the Heavens, they call upon God in time of trouble, and pour out their sorrows before the Lord, and he doth hear them.</p>
                  <p>Ninethly, God is with them by his raising pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce to raise up their hearts higher, to elevate their souls, and bring them more near to himself. Gods people when they meet with troubles in the world, oh nothing so sweet unto them as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God: then no life so sweet unto them as the life of faith; then they rellish a sweetness in the promise: then every smile of God, oh how welcome is it! then all the affections of their souls center in God, and run to God: as in winter time all the sap of the tree runs to the root: in summer time it spreads it self in the body, but in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goes to the root: when a man is sick, all the blood goes to the heart: so in a suffering conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the affections of the soul go to God.</p>
                  <p>But now what are the Reasons why God will not leave his people that thus desire to please him?</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:173109:56"/>
                  <p>Why, God loves them, therefore he will not leave them; persons we love we cannot leave: especially when they are in a distressed condition; and as God hath set his love upon them, so they have set their love upon God, they love God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.15. you have there an expression, <hi>Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore I will deliver him: he shall call upon me, and I will answer him, I will be with him in trouble.</hi> God is a God of bowels, of great pity and compassion, and therefore he will not leave his people in a time of distress: you know bowels how they stand in you towards them that are in misery; it goes to the heart of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful man to leave a person in misery: Oh how great are the bowels and compassions of God! <hi>Is Ephraim my son, is a he pleasant childe? Oh my bowels are turned within me, I will have mercy on him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as please God shall have his presence under suffering, because now they need God most: if God will not leave his people as to temporal supplies, because they need such and such things; they need meat, and they need cloathing: surely much more God will not leave his children as to spiritual supplies, under times of distress, because then they need God. Oh what can a Believer do? or what can a Believer suffer when God leaves him; his strength is in God: his support is in God: his comfort is in God: his all is in God, and therefore if God now leave him, what will become of him? he needs God at all times, but never so much as when his condition is dark and troubled.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173109:57"/> what was <hi>Sampson,</hi> that man of so great strength, when his hair was gone? and what is a Believer when his God his gone?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God loves to see his people chearful in a time of suffering, and therefore he is with them; he loves not that they should walk dejectly. When God is present, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> can sing in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: the Apostles can rejoyce, that God honours them to be reproached for him. When God is present, the people of God are not only chearful under tribulation, but can glory: their cross is their crown: but if God be withdrawn, what can there be? drooping hearts, and pensive sorrows.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God will not leave them, because they will not leave God: God will not leave them, because they suffer for his sake: were they not tender of Gods glory, and careful to please him, they might be free from suffering as well as others; but it is for Gods sake they suffer; <hi>For thy sake we are killed like sheep all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, It is thus, because God will make it appear to all the world, that he puts a difference between them that desire to please him, and other men: God hath a value for such: Do but see how <hi>Moses</hi> argues the case with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.13. and so on, where he comes to God with a great request, that God should shew him his way that he might know it: why faith God to him, <hi>My presence shall go with thee. Moses</hi> said unto him, It is well thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to promise so great a mercy; <hi>If thy presence go
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:173109:57"/> not with me, carry us not hence: for wherein shall it be known that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in this, that thou goest with us?</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, <hi>Moses</hi> pleads with God, how his favour, and love, and mercy should be with them, unless he were present with them: and so God, he walks with his people in trouble; for how should the world see God regarded them, and did favour them, unless he manifested his presence unto them in a time of trouble and affliction?</p>

                  <p n="12">12. The want of <hi>mutual forbearance</hi> among Christians. Alas Christians know not how to bear one with another in the least kind of measure.

And this is the lamentation we may take up, that truly to this very day we have not faith enough to carry us from one miracle to another, from one deliverance to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from one salvation to another: let one delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance passe over our head, and no sooner one wave rises higher then another, but we are ready to cry out with <hi>Peter. Lord save me, I perish:</hi> and well were it if our fears did issue into tears, and cryes after Christ: we rather are ready to cry out, as those in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. <hi>Our bones are dryed, and our hope is lost, we are cut off for our parts.</hi> We are a people that never knew how to honour God in any distress God hath brought us into; never learnt to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God by believing: if we cannot see him, we cannot believe him: surely that which God hath done for us in such a succession of miracles, it might well at least have been food for our faith during our sojourning: In our pilgrimage we might have learned by all that we have seen to believe God: we might have made experience to be the food of our faith: and upon all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of divine Power, Wisdome and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we might have discoursed our selves into belief, as <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.37. <hi>The Lord that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me out of the paw of the Lion, and of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.</hi> So <hi>Paul, He hath delivered, and doth deliver; we trust he will also deliver.</hi>

We cannot look any way but we see cause of bitter mourning; but we have not laid the blood of <hi>Germany, Lituania, Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, &amp;c.</hi> to heart; therefore God may justly lay it to our Charge. Want of fellow-feeling with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in their afflictions, it is a kind of Persecution, a kind of being accessarie to their Sufferings. That we have not mourned, wept bled with them; that we have not lyen in the dust, smote on our thighs, &amp;c. God may justly say to us, as <hi>Am.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>They shall go captive with the first that go captive, because they are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joseph. The word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifies, None of them have been <hi>sick</hi> for the affliction of <hi>Ioseph:</hi> Oh my Brethren! when did we go to bed <hi>sick</hi> for the afflictions of Gods people abroad? when did their miseries cost us an hours sleep? or a meal? meat? when did we lye in the dust, and cry out, Ah Lord! their Glory?

                  <p>So in the Text <hi>[Do the first works]</hi> Sin is a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from God; Repentance a comming back again to God.

                  <p>Apostacy is the losse of our <hi>first love: Repentance</hi> is the Recovery of it, and <hi>Reformation</hi> is the <hi>doing</hi> of our <hi>first works.</hi> I have not time to enlarge as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; I shall onely offer a few things, that might help to quicken you to this great duty.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, we have no great cause to boast of <hi>Englands first love:</hi> Never so good as it should be yet many can remember when <hi>England</hi> hath been much better then tis.</p>
                  <p>Time was, when Doctrines have been more sound; <hi>Discipline</hi> more excercised for the suppressing of sin and profanenesse; <hi>Ordinances</hi> kept more pure from sinful mixtures; when <hi>London</hi> kept <hi>Sabbaths</hi> better then now; loved their <hi>Godly Ministers</hi> more then now; honoured them that were set over her, for their works sake; would have thought nothing too good for a faithful Minister; when Christians loved one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a deare hearty-fervent love; when there was lesse <hi>Complement,</hi> but more real love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction among Christians; when Christians improved their meetings, converse, Christian Conference, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soul duties to better purpose then now; not to foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:173109:67"/> disputations, or wanton sensual excesses, but to their mutual edification; when they improved their time for comparing their evidences, communicating their experiences, and building up one another in their most holy faith; when there was more Industry in Professors then now, to bring in <hi>Converts;</hi> when pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians though it their duty to be subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the vvork of their <hi>Ministers,</hi> to bring in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Christ, especially their Family.</p>
                  <p>Time vvas vvhen more care of <hi>Young Converts</hi> then novv; vvhen none could have looked out after Religion, but some or other ready to lend them their hand, and shevv them the vvay, explaining it clearly to them; but novv Young Converts may be snapt into separations and errour, and none looks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.</p>
                  <p>Time vvas vvhen more care of the truly godly poor; vvhen errour vvas more odious; vvhen Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery vvas more hated then novv; vvhen the name of a Toleration vvould have made Christians to have trembled; vvhen Christians vvere better acquainted vvith their Bibles; vvhen more time spent in secret prayer; vvhen more tender of one anothers Names and Honours, vvould heal one anothers Reputations, and vvould spread the lap of Charity over those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reports and scandals that might be cast upon them; vvhen Christians rejoyced more in one anothers good and mourned in one anothers sufferings; vvhen Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did more earnestly contend for the faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Our fears be very great, and truly our provocations be greater; our dangers are great, but our sins greater yet here is a word, here is matter of incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment, that yet there is <hi>Balm in Gilead,</hi> Phisick of Christs ovvn composition, for the reviving and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a back-sliding people.

                  <p>There is yet a means or tvvo I find in Scripture for the preventing of threatned ruin that hath been very near, that God hath prescribed for a people or person in great danger, vvhen ready to be cut off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
                  <p>Novv that vvhich I vvould commend to you, in reference to vvhat you vvould beg of God for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is,</p>
                  <p>First, In your addressing your self to God for that mercy your souls are set upon, and you vvrestle vvith God for, that you vvould make some special Vovv to God. I find the Saints have done so; vvhen redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to great Straits, not knovving vvhat to do: Thus
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:173109:68"/>
                     <hi>Jacob vowed a Vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my fathers house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God. And this Stone which I here set for a pillar, shall be Gods house.</hi> Gen. 28.20, 21, 22. The special thing <hi>Jacob</hi> vovvs, is, that he vvould continue in the pure vvorship of his fore-fathers, that he vvould still honour God as his God, in that vvay he vvould be vvorshipped; the special thing is, that he vvould build a house for the vvorship of God; here he vvould erect a place of publick vvorship. And thus <hi>Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their Cities. Num.</hi> 21.2. They vovved a vovv they vvould not spare any of the enemies of God, if he would deliver them into their hands. Thus <hi>Jephthah. Hannah, David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.30. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 132.1, 2. Certainly in times of great distresse, tis not improper or uncomely, but that which God may expect and take well, that you make some special Vow, if God would prevent your fears; if God would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue forfeited mercies, dearer to you then your lives, you would set apart some special thing for God, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the propagation of the Gospel abroad, for the maintenance of a godly ministry at home, for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the preaching of the Gospel in the dark cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Kingdom, &amp;c. This must have some cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with it; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We must be sure our Vow be of what is in our own power; we must not make vows of that vvhich is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:173109:69"/> none of our own. <hi>I hate Robbery for burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must not make a vow to God of that which hath been unjustly or unrighteously taken away, or vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from any. 'Tis <hi>Sacriledg</hi> instead of a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It must be of things warrantable and justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It must be of such things that we are not bound to doe, before vows, by the standing Obligation of Religion, and of our Profession; but of something that is in our own choice, that we will <hi>voluntarily</hi> make a free-will offering of to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We must take heed that we do not entertain a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious thought of our own vowes, as if we had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited a mercy at Gods hands by our vowes; God looks for some special vow at our hands, that we may shew how much we prize and value the mercy we would have, that we would be content to part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, though to the halfe of our Estate for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thing I find, is, that in the mean time we should do something by way of extraordinary bounty and charity to the relief of Gods indigent Servants. Thus the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Wherefore, <hi>O King, let my counsel be acceptable to thee; break off thy Sins by R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and thine Iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity,</hi> Dan. 4.27.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:173109:69"/>
                  <p>The Prophet advises him to break off his Sinnes by Righteousnesse, there's Reformation; and besides Reformation, that he would do something in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way to the relief of the poor. <hi>Mercy to the poor,</hi> what's that?</p>
                  <p>Interpreters conceive, by the <hi>poor</hi> here, he understands <hi>Gods poor,</hi> i. e. the poor Jews, that were now in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian captivity;</hi> he advises he would do something by way of sympathy to the Jews, to ease their yoaks and oppressions; break off thy Iniquities by pitying &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to thy poor Captives under thy power now at this time; take off their yoake, ease their burdens, and restore them to their liberties again. Thus do you and those that have been the instruments of your Conversion, or Edification, set apart something extraordinarie for their relief and supply. The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> seems to advise this to the King as it were, by way of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>There be two things in Repentance; in wrongs we have done there must be Confession, and Satisfaction or Restoration: He seems to advise this to make up com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pentance; namely, to make Restoration and Retribution of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t he had injuriously taken from the Jewes. Oh then! let me say, without breach of Charity, that whatsoever, except it be in this case of extraordinary supplyes for his poor, it will be found but making Restitution and Satisfaction. It may be upon a two fold ground.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:173109:70"/>1. With some it may be truly Restitution and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation of what he hath <hi>taken away</hi> by <hi>unjust means,</hi> God knows how; that's between God and their own Souls, what unlawful means hath been used to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the heap, and swell their Estate.</p>
                  <p>If there be any that hears me this day, whose Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences shall tell them, that they have increased their Estate by undue and unwarrantable means; Oh <hi>Restore, Restore, break off your Iniquities by shewing mercy, &amp;c.</hi> by making Reparation as you can; it will be but like <hi>Zacheus</hi> giving half his goods to the poor, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring four-fold, &amp;c. in a liberal Contribution to the poor.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will be Restitution in another sence, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to an <hi>unjust withholding;</hi> some have have got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously, and I am afraid too too many have kept injuriously: Have we not <hi>rob'd</hi> the <hi>poor</hi> by an unjust denying of what God hath commanded us to distribute to their necessities? <hi>there is that withholdeth more than is meet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. &amp; 11.24. It may be God hath given you so much; there's Gods share, there's the Ministers portion, &amp;c. Now all that you have withheld beyond the <hi>Rule of Scripture,</hi> is all <hi>stoln goods,</hi> and is like a Wheat-sheat on fire, will burn down the whole barne of corn.</p>
                  <p>That which I would exhort you to, is, every one to set apart some considerable part of your Estate, and account it as a hallowed thing, dedicated to God, as a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:173109:70"/> thing which to touch were Sacriledge; that you may be ready on all occasions, in all regular and due wayes, to bring out for the relief of the Poor; you know objects abounding in every place, and you may expect warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means for dispenceing of what God shall put into your hearts in this matter.</p>

                  <p>I Was upon these words in the morning; having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken something to them as they referre to Christ who spake them here of himself; I then brought them down to his Members, Believers: and so propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In the prosecuting of this point I spake to four things, which I shall not now repeat, but come to the mark which I intend at present; and that is, to make some Application.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let me endeavour to prevail with every one of you, so to carry your selves in your several places and capacities, that whatever you do, you may please God.</p>
                  <p>It was a blessed testimony that was given of <hi>Enoch, Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</hi> Oh! how happy will they be at the great day of Judgement, who shall be singled out by Christ, before Angels and men; and Christ shall say of them, This was the Man, or this was the Woman that pleased God: There is a great deal of pleasing in the World, but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e are but very few that make this their businesse, to please God; therefore I would have you shun that which is sinfull, and presse after that which is matter of Duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are some that mind nothing but to please themselves, to promote their own interest, to love their own ease, to indulge themselves in their own carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; but they never mind the good of others, or the pleasing of God; the Apostle speaks of and against these, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs that look no further than the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of men; if they can but keep fair with men, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:173109:72"/> shun the displeasure of men, that is all they aime at; but my Brethren, what a poor thing is it to please man, and displease God? what a poor thing is it to have Man to be your Friend, and God to be your Enemy! to have the smiles of a poor dying perishing Worme, and to lye under the frownes of the great God!</p>
                  <p>Indeed there is a good pleasing of men, to please them for their Edification, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.2. and so the Apostle speaks of himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Even as I please all men in all things,</hi> that is, in all things that are of an indifferent nature, not simply civil, nor simply good, in all such things.</p>
                  <p>This Apostle was of a yielding and complying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he might thereby the better infinuate himself into the affections of men, and be more instrumental to the glory of God in the work of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. <hi>To the weak became I as weak, that</hi> I <hi>might gain the weake; I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some; and this</hi> I <hi>do for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now in matter of Dutie, such things as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly determined by God, and so are either good or evil; in these things the Apostle would be no pleaser of men: <hi>If I should please men, I should not be the Servant of Christ,</hi> 1 Gal. It is good to please others to their Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but we must not please others to their own ruine and condemnation; It is good to please men, when we can so do, and not grieve God.</p>
                  <p>Instead of pleasing men, let it be your constant care and best endeavour in all things to please God: my Brethren this is a duty of so great impor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ance, that was I now to take my leave of you, and should certainly know that I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173109:73"/> should never speak to you more, as we are come very near to that; for though I speak to you as a living man, yet I speak to you as a dying Minister; this I say, is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that weight and importance, that I know not what to presse upon you more material than this; consult but two places of Scripture, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>For this cause we do not cease to pray for you:</hi> What was the thing the Apostle in this his constant Prayer did begge of God for them? It was this, That they might please God; and when he was taking his leave in the winding up of his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, Now the God of peace, that b ought again from the dead our Lord Iesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covenant, make you perfect in every good wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not go beyond the Text for Motives to stirre you up to these Endeavours: For</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 1. First, Consider what that God is which I would have you endeavour to please; He is that God which made Heaven and Earth; that God before whom all this World is as nothing, but as a little dust in the ballance, and as a drop of water to the bucket; that God whom Angels adore and worship; that God who by a word from his mouth is able to bring the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse into nothing. Will not you study to please this God? But further consider what this God is to you: He is the fountain of your being; he is the God of all your mercies; he is your Creatour and Soveraign; he is your Maker and Law-giver. It is he that by a smile can make you happy, and by a frowne can make you miserable; it is he that hath Heaven and Hell
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:173109:73"/> at his disposal, <hi>who openeth and none can shut, who shuts and none can open.</hi> He that must judge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you either to eternal blessednesse, or else to eternal torments; it is he in whose hands your breath, your life, your soul, your All is; will you not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to please this God? as the Prophet argueth in point of fear, <hi>Isay</hi> 51.12. <hi>Who art thou that art afraid of a man that shall dye, or of the Son of man that shall be made as grasse, and forgettest the Lord thy maker?</hi> Oh poor Creature, who art thou that goest about to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ease a mortal dying man, and dost not go about to please the Great God, thy Creatour and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider that Relation wherein you professe your selves to stand to God; he is your Master, you his Servants; he is your Father, you his Children; he is your Lord, you his Subjects: You know all that are in close Relations, will study to please them that are above them, as the Servant his Master, the Childe his Father, the Subject his Prince; All persons that are in a state of Inferiority, will study to please their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, especially when they do depend upon them. Oh! how infinitely is God above those Relations! Alas, there is but a very little distance betwixt you and your Servants, and yet you expect they should please you; will you not therefore please God? especially considering your dependence upon him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You shall not lose by pleasing God; that is enough to put us upon this; He that pleaseth God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fireth himself; in that very act wherein we please God,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173109:74"/> we profit our selves: Men can do but little for us, and yet upon what they can do, we study to please them.</p>
                  <p>Let me open this in a few particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you will sincerely endeavour in all things to please God, God will give you a gracious return to all your prayers. Oh what a mercy is this for a man to have his prayers answered by God! 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.22. <hi>Whatever we aske, we receive of him, because we keep his commandements, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</hi> Never expect that God should hear any Prayers, if we do not endeavour to do those things that please him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do you please God, and he will please you; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy pleaseth us, and Duty pleaseth God. Now when we please God in a way of Duty, he will please us in a way of Mercy: If we order our wayes so as to please God, he will order his wayes so as to please us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Great is the benefit of pleasing God, even as to men; and this <hi>Solomon</hi> sets before you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. <hi>VVhen a mans wayes please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;</hi> and he hath such another expression, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that loveth pureness of heart, the King shall be his Friend:</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Scripture is this, When we keep close to God, and walk in complyance with his will, and make it our great design to please him, He will give us to find favour in the eyes of men: He that maketh God his Friend, God will make that mans Enemies to be his Friends. Men are possibly full of Anger, Revenge, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:173109:74"/> Exasperation: be it so: Do you desire to please God? God can turne their Hearts towards you; God can sweeten them in their Spirits, and take away that Venome that is in them: so you know he did in the Case of <hi>Esau</hi> to his Brother <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is the way to Heaven and Happiness; God will be pleased before the Sinner shall be saved. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Enoch <hi>before his translation had this testimony that he pleased God;</hi> there is no way to Heaven but by this way: the Childe pleaseth the Father, and then the Father giveth him the Inheritance. So it is here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let me return to the Argument in the Text; God will never leave them alone, that desire sincerely to please him. Methinks this should be a very prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Motive to you, especially now; Please God, and he will never leave you, no not in a time of distress and trouble. Here is the great difference betwixt a faithfull God, and a false Man.</p>
                  <p>In time of trouble and adversity men leave us and forsake us; in time of prosperity then they flatter us, and pretend a great deal of friendship and kindness: But as no man looks upon the Dial when the Sunne is under a cloud; so these very men that pretend so much of kindness and friendship, if so be we do but come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a frown, or in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o trouble, then their friendship and kindness is at an end, as <hi>Paul</hi> said, No man stood by him when he came to be tryed before <hi>Nero;</hi> all men forsook him, but God did not forsake him. The wise man hath an expression, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17. <hi>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity;</hi> But where shall we find such a friend? and indeed where
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173109:75"/> shall we find such a brother? But now if you w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll please God, God will stand by you when all men leave you; When you have the greatest need of God, he will then stand by you; If you be in a Prison, he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll be with you; If you be banished, he will be with you: If Sinne do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h not part God and you, certainly no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction shall part God and you.</p>
                  <p>Studie to please God; Oh! is it not a sad thing for God to leave you? that is the saddest of all; when we lose God we lose all, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.12. <hi>VVo unto them when I depart from them.</hi> What are all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies if God leave you? no more than if a man shou d have a fair pleasant House, and never see the Sunne more.</p>
                  <p>Oh do the things that alwayes please the Lord, and he will never leave you; under mercies, under affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he will be with you, and then your mercies shall be verie sweet, and your afflictions shall not be very bitter; You know how earnest <hi>Moses</hi> was, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.31. with his Father in law, <hi>Hohab</hi> the <hi>Midianite, Leave us not</hi> I <hi>pray thee, forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayst be to us as eyes.</hi> Oh keep God to you, especially when you are entering into the wilderness of trouble, God will be to you instead of eyes; he will be your Counsellor, your Comforter, your Guide, your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, your Portion, your All.</p>
                  <p>I might adde one thing more in the last place.</p>
                  <p>Studie to please God, because he is so easie to be pleased; this is a motive to us to endeavour to please
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:173109:75"/> those persons who are easie to be pleased; a Childe that hath a Father that is easie to be pleased, a Servant that hath a Master that is easie to be pleased, will study to please them. Sincerity pleaseth God, though in the midst of much infirmity; He is so gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, that wheresoever a poor sinner doth but desire to please God, he will accept of those desires; If we can b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Do those things now, make Conscience of those Duties which now lye upon you, in the doing of which you will certainly please God: And they are such as these:</p>

                  <p>Love the people of God whatever the World say or think of thee; for God is highly pleased when he seeth his Children loved.</p>

                  <p>The third use is for comfort, to all those that do conscientiously endeavour in all things to please God; the comfort lies in this, you may suffer; but whenever you suffer, the Father will not leave you alone; pleasing of God does not secure a man from suffering from men, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it rather exposes a man to suffer from men: But now, though it does not prevent suffering, yet it takes away the sting and venome of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; it makes it to be like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Lyon, when it was slain, he found nothing but honey in the belly of it. Oh! the presence of God in a time of affliction, is exceeding precious; it turns gall into honey, thornes into roses. Bee not troubled in your thoughts, about what you may undergo; if God be with you, all will be well; if God comes when the crosse cometh, the weight of it shall never hurt you: what is a prison when God is there? My brethren, though estate leave you, relations leave you, all your comforts leave you; so long as God doth not leave you it will be well; therefore do not fear, be not dejected or discouraged. <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.1, 2. <hi>Fear not, O Jacob;</hi> why so? <hi>when thou passest through the water, I will be with thee.</hi> We have more reason to be afraid of prosperity, with Gods absence, then of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, with Gods presence. A good God will make every condition to be good; it is not a prison but a pallace, where God is: they that do the things that please God, whatever condition they may be brought to, the Father will not leave them alone.

Then be tender and charitable in judging of those that do differ from you and others, upon this account, because they dare not displease God. I may in this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aime at my self, and others of my brethren in the work of our ministry; but I am not here at present to take my last farewell; I hope I may have a little further opportunity of speaking to you; but if not, let me require this of you, to pass a charitable interpretation upon our laying down the exercise of our ministry; there is a greater judge then you, must judge us all at the great day; and to this judge, we can appeal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Angels and Men; that it is not this thing, or that thing, that puts us upon this dissent but it is conscience towards God, and fear of offending him. I censure none that differ from me, as though they displease God; but yet, as to my self, should I do thus and thus, I should certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violate the peace of my own conscience, and offend God, which I must not do; no, not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my ministry; though that either is, or ought to be, dearer to me then my very life; and how dear it is, God only knoweth. Do not add af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to affliction, be not uncharitable in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, as if through pride, faction, obstinacy, or devotednesse to a party, or which is worse then all, in opposition to authority, we do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; the judge of all hearts knows it is not so.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:173109:78"/> But it is merely from those apprehensions which after prayer, and the use of all meanes, do yet continue; that doing thus and thus, we should displease God; therefore deal charitably with us in this day of our affliction. If we be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, I pray God to convince us: if others be mistaken, whether in a publick or private capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, I pray God in mercy convince them; but however things go, God will make good this truth to us; in this work he will not leave us, and our Father will not leave us alone; for it is the unfained desire of our soul, in all things to please God.</p>

He is willing to save us from the guilt and power of sin, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be our Lord, Head, Intercessor with God, Justifier and <hi>all</hi> unto us; and if we consent to this, and take him as offered, this is receiving Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Receiving of Christ contains these two things; or these two things are essentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:173109:80"/> to make up the nature of saving Faith: <hi>i. e.</hi> to believe the Doctrine of the Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jesus Christ to be true, and to consent that the goodnesse that is therein revealed and proposed shall be ours To believe what Christ <hi>is,</hi> and what he hath <hi>done</hi> so far to believe it, as here we are resolv'd to venture our souls, (though there may be some weaknesse through our faith's imperfection) and believing this Gospel to be the certain word of God. Then next, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Christ that is offered in this Gospel to be ours, with all the benefits that accompany, and to all the blessed ends to which he is revealed: Thus the water of life is freely tendered to all that are <hi>athirst,</hi> and there is no more required but <hi>come</hi> and <hi>drink</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there is two things implyed, that are the immediate products of this saving Faith, and inseparable from it: <hi>i. e. trusting</hi> on him as <hi>the Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> him as a Lord. To <hi>rest</hi> upon him as a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> Rom. 15.12. And here, as far as the soul feels entertainment and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement by Christ, overcoming his doubts that Christ will reject him, &amp;c. so far hee hath quietness of soul in Christ, and will trust h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s soul upon Christ. And then, the <hi>obeying</hi> of him in order to our full recovery, (as a Patient must obey his Physitian) in using his remedies, and meanes he prescribes for killing our sins, restore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our soules to Gods love, and being with him to eternity.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:173109:81"/>
                  <p>The nature of Faith is to receive Christ; the sincerity of it lies in the suitablenesse of the act to the object; that we receive him as he is: Now in Christ there is something essential to this act; that he be a Saviour, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, &amp;c. and there is something makes unto the well-being, and fuller attaining of the end: The first are the objects of Faith it self, as 'tis of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity to salvation: The second sort are, the objects of Faith, as it is strong, and makes to the well-being of a Christian. All that is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Christ, as a Saviour, and Redeemer, is to be believed by him, that will approve himself a true believer. And thus to receive Christ as the eternal Son of God, made man, the Redeemer of the world, ruling us upon the right of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, justifying us before God, bringing us to God, and interceding for us: And thus Christ must be received according to his Offices, and as those uses for which he is given to the soul, do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and imply.</p>
                  <p>For the application of this point.</p>
                  <p>First, let us begin with those that our businesse at present doth not mainly lye on. Must men <hi>walk in Christ as they have received him?</hi> What shall wee say to those that <hi>have not, will not receive him?</hi> stop us at the door, that we can't bring in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:173109:81"/>
                     <hi>Doctrine of Christ;</hi> that will not <hi>receive the principles of Christ.</hi> How can we bring them, and build them up, that will not suffer the <hi>Foundation</hi> to be laid, the seed to be received? Hast thou not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ? Then thou hast refused Christ, been a despiser of the Gospel of Christ, which will prove thy great condemnation. What is it for thee to hear the <hi>Name,</hi> and not to have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ? Do not go upon <hi>conjectures:</hi> it's one thing to number thy self with those that are <hi>Christians,</hi> as to <hi>outward appearance,</hi> and another thing to <hi>open thy heart,</hi> and deliver up thy self to Christs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and as a lost sinner, to receive him to those ends a Saviour must be received. And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, this was no small Work, God's sending Christ into the World; no small thing to fetch thee from Hell and Satan, to wash guilty souls from all their sins, and to bring them to everlasting glory. If these great things be rightly understood and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thee, if Christ be understood well as Christ, it must be done with a wakened, humbled, self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing heart, making the greatest matter in the World of these things: Hath thy soul been seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously taken up about thy own recovery? And hast thou received Christ as a man that was ready to be damned? as one that had a load on his soul hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than all the Mountains of Earth, to ease and deliver him? As one that was under the frowns of God, in an estate of enmity, receives reconciliation? Hast thou received Christ, as if thou hadst received Heaven in him? Believe it, these are great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and will affect thy heart; and it is not a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:173109:82"/>
                     <hi>sleepy</hi> or <hi>jesting</hi> matter thus to receive Christ. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is to receive Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Tf you have received Christ, you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the great <hi>Reconciler,</hi> that binds up the broken-hearted, quiets those that tremble under the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God, for fear he should forsake, and cast them off for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou hast received Christ, thou hast recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a perfect <hi>enmity</hi> to <hi>all sin,</hi> that will never let thee <hi>rest</hi> in sin but be perswading thee from it, and conflicting in thee against sin in thy soul: If thou hast received Christ, thou hast not received a friend for sin, that will plead for, or give thee leave to commit sin: but one, that though he bear with thee in thy weaknesse, yet abominates thy sin. If thou hast received a Lord and Master to rule, to be consented and subjected to him, and to be ruled by none but in subordination to him, who will break those in pieces that refuse his Government. <hi>Obedience,</hi> and not <hi>verbal Profession,</hi> is the thing he requires. Hast thou entertained Christ to be the Master of thy words, thoughts and deeds, whose Government thou livest under, more than under any in the world?</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. If you have received Christ, you have then received the beginning of felicity and full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your soules; having found none in your sins, you have it discovered to you where it is: therefore with gladnesse you go on: and so far as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:173109:82"/> you have hopes of attaining it, so far you have great contentment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, In a word, if you have received Christ, you have fallen out with sin; subjected pleasures, profits and honors to him; and you have received his Spirit, and this Spirit hath made you new, and maintains a War within you against the flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be not thy case, Oh that thou knewest what a case thou art in! For then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What the better art thou for all his blood shed as yet, if thou wert this day to dye? What would Christs blood do to the cleansing and saving of thy soul?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How canst thou look thy sins in the face, and think on what thou hast done and art? How canst thou look inward into thy defiled heart, and not tremble, when thou hast no more shelter from the wrath of God?</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, How canst thou look God in the face, who is a hater of sin? How canst thou read his Attributes, think on his Threatnings, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How canst thou think to have any duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, any prayer heard, or rewarded? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:173109:83"/>5. How canst thou think on the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the time when thou must receive thy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sentence, if thou hast not received Christ? Oh what a thing is a Christless heart! <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. What shall I do that I may receive Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Till Christ be thine, and hath brought peace from Heaven to thy soul, let no peace be there to keep him out: I do not say overwhelm thy self with sorrow; but let sorrow dwell there, and let holy cares and solicitousness about thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual state be there till Christ come and quiet, and reconcile thee to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Read and believe the Gospel, see there what Christ is, and thy necessity of him: <hi>Believing</hi> will open the door to <hi>entertaining</hi> him; <hi>assent</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thy <hi>consent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Keep up no Idol in thy heart against him: Turn out that that keeps out Christ. How dear soever it seems now, at last thou wilt see it more necessary to detect, than keep it.</p>
                  <p>I come now to exhort all poor weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that they would make after confirmation, and grow to a greater measure in Grace, as they have received Christ. It is not enough to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited</hi> that you have been converted; and it will not be enough to the assurance of your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:173109:83"/> or safety of your souls, that you think you are converted and sit down there: He that is content with the opinion he hath Grace, therefore desires to have no more, because the promise of salvation is made to the <hi>Truth of Grace,</hi> it's a sign he never had Grace; <hi>strength in Grace,</hi> is your own felicity, 'tis part of your happiness: Your eternal happiness will partly consist in your <hi>personal perfection;</hi> and without personal perfection, all heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will not be a perfect felicity. If you have fixed your Anchor in God's Promises, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages you to look up, make after, and proceed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take these Motives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider, there is the same reason to move thee to grow and proceed, as there was to move thee to thy first beleeving. Why did you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christians, but because of the necessity of the riches and excellencies of Christ, and that there was better things in Christ, than in the World? And are they not so still? Is the case changed? If Christianity was reasonable then, it is reasonable now; if it was necessary to begin, it is necessary to hold on; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in your Race, till you have obtained the Crown.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your receiving Christ essentially, contains
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173109:84"/> in it an obligation to proceed and go further, actually to trust and obey him, whom you have taken for your Lord and Saviour from the very offices and relations of Christ received.</p>
                  <p>If I be a Father, where is my fear? If I bee a Master where is my Honour? If I be a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, where is your Confidence in me, submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to my saving-work, Obedience to my heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Precepts? If I be your Lord and Master, why do not you learn of me as your Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your first Covenant engages you to proceed in fulfilling the things promised in your Covenant, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Better not to have promised to be his people, than to promise and break this promise. The very <hi>Mercies</hi> also you received from him, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning yotir former sin, entertainment in his Church, and all the blessing there found, are as so many obligations to proceed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ever since we came home to Christ, we have had an addition of Reasons, besides the first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we had to believe: Every day brings in new, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly if a little were desirable, more were more desirable: If the people that stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, and never tried what Christ and Grace is, were bid to <hi>come in,</hi> those that have tryed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, are bound to proceed much more: You have the Spirit of God, experiences of his love, tasted the bitterness of sin, have had some trial of the truth of such things of which we speak, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:173109:84"/> have <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>see not,</hi> &amp;c. and will you turn back that have tasted? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider how much hath been lost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many a soul for want of care to take root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to proceed? How much labour of the Ministry, mercies of God, pains and care of their own? I speak of those that have seemed sincere, not indeed so; that have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times comforted the hearts of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Friends, and have had some kind of comfort to themselves in that taste they have had of the good word of God. How many times hath the Preacher been gladded to see such a one come to him, seemingly with a broken heart, seeming to set themselves in the way of life? yet the flesh prevailed for want of confirmation. How many yeares have some spent in duty, in hearing, prayer, gracious society, profession of Religion? yet afterwards the world hath drown'd all. What cause have you to see you lose not the thing you have wrought?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Consider how much of the works of your own salvation when you are converted, is yet undone. Though you are sure your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version is true, how many temptations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, enemies to conquer, duties to perform, and Heaven to be taken upon all those terms,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:173109:85"/> as is the tenour of your Christianity! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had need to stand fast, and having done all, to stand; you had need not onely to believe, but to wait and be patient in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to proceed in the way you have chosen.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The want of strength and building up, makes the lives of many full of lamentable languishing weaknesses, scandals unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, pain, calamity and trouble to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. How long in healing? And how much smart and pain, while the fruit of their own folly is cured? How little, and how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do temptations prevail? And hence as in a wilderness, they are going one step forward, another backward, no evident keeping in God, and all through the fruit of their own languishing weakness; the fruits of the sins of Professors have been such, that it should make you do all you can possible to escape the troubles at home, and reproaches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A life of spiritual weaknesse is usually a burden unto him that hath it, it doth not onely occasion his falling into sinne, and so renewes the wounds of his soul, but is a constant burden to him; not that any measure of Grace is troublesome,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:173109:85"/> but that which consists with so great a measure of remaining corruption, this is the burden: sickness is burdensome though there be life. Me thinks you should not then be reconciled to your fears: you should methinks see so great difference between the sick and well, that for your own peace sake you should seek after confirmation: Every duty they do is their pain, which is anothers pleasure: pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their burden: sometimes tired, wearied, dull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> presently overwhelmed with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: every duty is a grievance to them, through the weakness of their grace and their corruption.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Christians that are weak and not confirmed, lose abundance of the fruit of Gods Ordinances that are improved by others: how many a truth that tasts exceeding sweet to others, hath no great relish to them, nor growth by it! A healthful man hath more relish in ordinary fare then a sick person in varieties: the full stomack loaths the Honey-comb.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The weak and unconfirmed Christian is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, comparatively unto others; not that the Church would wish the weakest member out, but comparatively, unconfirmed Christians are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unprofitable unto others, like little children in the family, that must be looked to, make work for a great many more about them. What doth a sick person? but the work of others is to feed, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and be a help to him. The Church of God hath need of strong Christians that can pray in faith, fervencie for others, and you can scarcely pray for your selves. Consider when the Church needs a great deal of help, will you sit down with low attainments and little things, when so many hundreds about you need so great assistance?</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:173109:86"/>10. Weak persons are many times the troublers and very dangers of the Church; many calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been occasioned by them. The sins of Professors have occasioned the displeasure of God on the Church: their Errors hindred truth and made divisions. When Christians have not so much strength as to know truth from error, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to every one that speaks with likeness: What have these Christians done in the Church? What mercies have been driven away so far, that I think the Church of God, since the Apostles days till now, hath suffered more by the sins of Professors, then the malice of their enemies. And how canst thou expect God will save thy soul, when thou hast set the Church on fire, and been so great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to others, that many should perish occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by thy example? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The greatest sufferings of the Church have come from the miscarriages of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Such have been the great dishonourers of Christ; and the graces of ancient Christians, the glory of their profession: their charity, self-denial, heavenly-mindedness, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> preached the Gospel to the world more effectually then ever their words could do. God expects your lives should be a considerable means for the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wicked men: the same God that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Ministers to teach others by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, hath commanded you should live for the conversion of the world; that your zeal, humility, patience, charity, self-denial, should win souls to God. And if it be a sin to give over preaching when we may, surely so to give over living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:173109:86"/> If <hi>woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel,</hi> then <hi>wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you if by your lives you preach not the Gospel.</hi> How many sinners have you about you, and how do you wrong and rob the ungodly of that Ordinance God hath appointed for their conversion and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? You are the persons that take the bread out of their mouths, the means that should save them out of their hands, while you deny them one of the commanded means of salvation, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent example of your lives:</hi> And if it be so great a sin to stop Preachers mouths, how great a sin to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this Ordinance? Nay, are you not a dishonour to the Church? Is it not because of Professors ill lives, that the prophane deride Religion, while they see not that glory in it that should over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er an unbeleeving and denying soul, and should indeed effectually manifest its excellency? Are these the Professors, that are proud, stubborn, passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, censorious, self-conceited, contemptuous, and envious as any others? I know the world is apt enough to slander, and the Servants of God bear a world of unjust reproaches: but oh that there were not this occasion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Those that are not confirmed and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in grace, the Devil, when he hath prevailed by a temptation on themselves, can easily make them his Instruments to draw and tempt others from their duty, to discourage them in their Religion, and to do that mischief in the world he hath done, by temptation on their own soul. 'Tis ordinary for Satan to make use of lapsed, distempered Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to be the instruments of his temptations to those that are better, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An honest Christian
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:173109:87"/> will not so easily hearken to a drunkard, swearer, as to a prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="13">13. For want of strength and establishment in grace, poor weak Christians are a very great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the carnal hopes of wicked men. I think scarce any thing in the world hinders our preaching more then this; when the wicked see those that make the greatest profession no better then themselves, and in some things worse, this hardens him against all the convictions that can be brought against him: tell him he cannot be saved without conversion, he looks upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, sees them contentious, worldly, peevish, passionate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sees some sin or other, this makes him think he is as well as they: must there be so much ado to bring men to this state? Is this the difference? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Methinks it should be some trouble to an honest heart, that yet we must be so like to the children of the wicked one: and the weakest chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, are the likest to the wicked: I do not mean weakness in gifts, or knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in practical saving knowledge, love of God, self-denial, mortification, heavenly-mindedness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they that are in these the weakest Christians, are the next and likest to the wicked: And doth not this grieve thee, that though thou art not a child of the Devil, thou art so like one? We should not be conformed to the world, nor like to them in any thing, no not in outward vanities: but to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the fashi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="15">15. Consider what a dangerous and lamentable standing those have that be not established, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you stand, but it is as un-rooted plants or trees that stand shaking in the wind: beholders are alwayes looking when they fall: you stand, but it is as a sick man, wavering, reeling, like <hi>Lots wife,</hi> looking back, and alwayes upon every occasion ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: You have been Believers; little things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and trouble you; little tribulations and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions discompose and disturb you; little temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations make you question the Scripture, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, his love and care of his people, and the great foundations of Religion: Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions seem to shake, because you are shaking and tottering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what is like to become of such a soul? If thou stand shaking under small temptations, for want of confirmation, what wilt thou do when a Papist, or Quaker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall so speak concerning Religion, which thou art not able to answer? and so the surest foundation seems nothing when thou hast so weak hold: our greatest afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, next to the misery of the ungodly, is to think of our weak ones, what will become of them: and verily we do expect a considerable part of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation should be carried away: those that are <hi>Christians and know not why,</hi> yet have not humility enough to make use of others, and to keep close to those that should assist them. Remember when you see such times, when seducers are able to say the worst, shall make the strongest assaults on the weak ones, how many will be like to fall?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:173109:88"/> Again sickness, death, dying times will come, when you shall find a little grace will not easily do your work; and though you perish not, yet you may faint, and to your sorrow finde the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. You cannot but know how the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est are put to it in trying houres, or at death. Will slack and unsetled hopes of another life, such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered hearts fight and encounter with such tryals? Never think of dying comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, if you follow not after confirming grace.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. It should humble you the more, that you have been so long, so many years in the School of Christ, and love God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no better: Should not you in this Apprenticeship have learned better your Religion, and been teachers of others, when perhaps, if in the principles you are assaulted, you will show your weakness as soon as any May not Christ say, <hi>Have I been so long time with you,</hi> and yet have you <hi>known, liv'd,</hi> &amp;c. no <hi>better?</hi> reached no higher, attained no further? weaklings still? Nay consider in this time what advantage have you had for growth? A tree planted on a barren wilderness may not grow so much as in a fruitful place: but you have had the plenty and power of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, the choicest of the means and helps of salvation.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Consider, the nature of true grace tends to this: will you cross the nature of it? shall we be such weaklings in Religion, which crosse so the nature of <hi>grace?</hi> for <hi>grace,</hi> the more its exercised, the more it <hi>encreases.</hi>

Heaven it self is perfection, and the work of a Christian is to press towards heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis to press towards perfection.

                  <p n="1">1. A confirmed Christian is one <hi>that can resist many subtil and strong temptations,</hi> not only a single temptation, but when Satan assaults on every side, with errors on both extreames, with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of several parties, with temptations of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity offered, of adversity felt or feared; strong
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:173109:89"/> temptations that seem to lay a necessity of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a weakling, that makes him say, <hi>I</hi> must do it to save my liberty, family, life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A strong chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can say, there is no necessity: he can make light of those temptations that seem to be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to other persons: he can confute a subtil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister, and deal with a cunning Adversary: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cannot so easily go beyond and out-wit him.</p>

He can do great, excellent and useful work, is serviceable to God if he have opportunity in business of greatest consequence he doth not serve God only in some little and inconsiderable things, but in his place sets himself to the work of God, doth the great work of his Majesty faithfully: The service of God to him is more easie and delightful, as to go ten miles is more easie to the healthful, then one to a sickly person: he can go through Gods service with pleasure, ease and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, without tyring, fainting, sitting down, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over.</p>

He can digest the hard Truths and Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, that are ready to puzzle, perplex, and overset the stomack of a weak christian: He hath laid his foundation, to which he reduces all things of difficulty, and by the help of those great truths he hath received, he can easily see through the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of all that are yet before him. He can tell how to reconcile those things in Scripture that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173109:89"/> seem contradictions: where he meets with a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he can easily discern the cause is in himself, and that there is an undoubted way of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, though he hath not attained to it. He can easily quiet his soul under the most difficult providences, and interpret them so as is consistent with the truths of God, which must expound them: he reconciles providence with providence, and providence with Scripture: whereas a weak christian is ready to say, <hi>A hard saying, who can bear this and that?</hi> And 'tis the difficulty of these kinds of Truths, that make so many turn their Religion, because not able to digest the hardest Truths of God. Cross providences makes them question Gods love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

He can do many works, believe many truths, perform many duties at once. He can rejoyce and sorrow at once, and make his sorrow a help to his joy, and his joy a help to his sorrow, and so exercise both in that nature as will not directly hinder or weaken one another. He can tell how in such a time as we are in to rejoyce, yet to be humble: to be cast down at Gods feet in the sense of the sins we have committed, and of Gods displeasure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet to rejoyce in the mercies we have, and do expect to possess. He doth not look all upon sin, all upon affliction, or all upon mercy: but can
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:173109:90"/> eye every thing, and give every thing its part: can exercise graces methodically, give truths and providences their proper place in his meditations and affections: and this makes his life orderly, beautiful, regular and useful: whereas a weak Christian, let him set himself against one tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is taken in another: if he humble himself in soul, he can do nothing but humble, weep, grieve, fear, and be ready to cast away all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, all sence of the love of God: if he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the consideration of the grace of Christ, he is apt to forget Humiliation, and to be puffed up with spiritual pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he hath not skill, strength and ability to carry on all the whole work of grace together.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A strong Christian sinks not under those bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens that would presse down and overwhelm a weak Christian: he can bear heavy burdens, and more easily away with them, making it a recreation to bear some things that another would sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and cannot bear. 'Tis thy weaknesse that makes thee make such a stir, when God layes on thee personal, family publick afflictions, that makes thee shrink under them: strength of grace would enable thee to see God and glory in the midst of them, and to say, <hi>all shall work for my good:</hi> it would enable thee to get advantage, and be bettered by them. Hadst thou streng h enough to improve them, thou wouldst take comfort from them, and support thy self under them: but when thou hast not strength enough to understand Gods meaning, to see the duty then called for, to improve all for God, to do that service to God thou shouldst do
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:173109:90"/> in such a condition, no wonder if thou have not grace to support and comfort thee in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereas the confirmed Christian by strong faith, love &amp; patience can carry great burthens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

They are so furnished with patience, which God hath given them for the use of the weak ones in his family, and though they are troublesome, or do that which might be a disturbance to them, they will not thrust them out; it is they that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the feeble, support, provide for, strengthen, and confirm the rest; and were it not for these, what back-sliding hearts should we have? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they are comparatively troublesome to few, (though, while corruption cleaves to them, they shall sometimes:) It is not they that are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:173109:91"/> quarrelling with one or other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these peevish, troublesome souls are the weak ones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Though in duty they should not be alone when they can have socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and though the rest are most humble, therefore are sensible they have need of others; and will not throw away any of their helps, yet if all forsake them, they will stand to it still: they go not to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meerly for company sake: they be not chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians meerly because such and such are christians: If all the world forsake Christ, they will stick to him, unless Christ leave them to their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But the weak Christian hath a great deal more need of comfort and support, and lives a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent life: they cannot stand, work, suffer alone: if their Minister fall, they fall: if their Relations change, they change: if there be not some-body at hand to confute an Adversary, they yield: if there be not some-body to keep life and warmth, they grow cold in every duty: in affliction they can step on no longer then led by the hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to support, and to quiet, and moderate their passions, and to teach them the Doctrine of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: they can hold up no longer then they are refreshed with cordials: What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, should God let you stand by your selves? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The strong Christian is one that can best live without creatures upon God alone (and a weak christian is one that hath most need of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:173109:91"/> and can least live upon God alone) under the censures of the godly, frowns of the wicked, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riches, honours, pleasures; can have quietness and contentment in God, whether he have any thing or nothing, wherever he is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The more necessity thou art in of having something besides God for thy consolation, the more weak thou art: there must be comfortable provision in the family, health, ease, liberty; there must be supply: I know not how to be poor, disgraced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this impatient soul is the feeble soul: Impatience is nothing but the fruit of weakness. The strong christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can live upon God alone: therefore if men make as if they were undone, if lost in their estates, 'tis a certain sign of a lamentable weakness of a sick soul.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That is the best and strongest christian, and most confirmed in grace, who is most employed and abides in the love of God, in love to God: That hath the fear of God, but goes beyond fear, and loves most, and abides most in the love of God: That makes it his great business to feed upon, and study the love of God to him, and to return love to him again. The more Gods love is on thy heart, and the more thou livest in the fruit of that love, the stronger christian. But he that lives most by a kind of constraining fear, though he may be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, he is but weak: where there is nothing but fear and no love, there is no sincerity; but where there is some little measure of love, fear is such a tyrant that it will many times cloud it, so that almost all his life seems to be moved
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:173109:92"/> and managed by fear: and in this there is much lothness and unwillingness, and they had rather do otherwise then they do: according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of love is the strength of grace.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He is the strongest christian that hath most pure and most universal love to others, that can love all men, even an enemy, with true, unfeigned love, even with such love as belongs to a christian: that can love every christian, and not a party only, with the pure and fervent love which belongs to Believers: that can love every child of God, and not those only that are of his opinion, or have done him good, but all because they are children of God, with a sincere and special hearty love. That is the weak christian that picks and chuses, that is staggering when he comes to loving an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: that takes in those that agree with him in judgement, and makes those almost only the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his love; that would confine his affections to some narrow society, some little sect, party, or parcel of Believers, and cannot love christians as christians: And hence it is, division is the effect of enmity, or of weakness in grace, for want of the universality of love. I would make no question to prognostick the healing of all divisions within this Nation, could I but advance all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it to the right temper of christian love. 'Tis the weak children in Christs family that falls out, when we have not enough love to reach to all, and to love a christian as a christian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. See that the foundation be soundly laid in your head and heart in matters of your Religion. In your head, <hi>i. e.</hi> that you well understand what Religion is, what the Christian Religion is: what God is: what it is for God to be yours, in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Relations unto you: what he is and will be unto you: what you are and must be unto him: what sin is, how odious, wherein its evil consists: what is sin, and what not: what sin hath done in the world, and what state it hath brought transgressors into: what Christ is, what he hath done for mans recovery and redemption: what he hath wrought, gives and offers to the world: The end and design of God in the work of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: The tender of the Gospel-Covenant of grace, freeness, largeness, and excellency of the grace of this Covenant: The end of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the everlasting glory that is revealed in the Gospel, what it is, how sure, and how great. When you understand these things, get a sound and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated belief concerning the Truths of the holy Scripture revealing all these things: And think it not enough that the Scripture is true, or that you
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:173109:93"/> are resolved so to believe, but get the best grounds for your belief, be well established on those grounds: Read the Scripture much, till you are acquainted with, and relish the matter and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and feel the power, untill all be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to your souls in reading. And be not ashamed to understand the Fundamentals: look to your Catechismes: The fundamentals of Religion you must understand and receive. And when you have got them into your head, be sure you get them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your heart, and never think any truth received as it ought, till it hath done some special work on your heart; till you believe that God is Almighty, Just, Holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Attributes of God have made their holy impression on your heart: that the sanctifying knowledge of God hath warmed your affections, captivated your souls, that God be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd in your hearts by the belief and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your minds: Know your selves so as to be humble: know <hi>Christ</hi> so as he may be sweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and exalted by you: set up <hi>Christ</hi> in your souls nearest to your hearts: know sin so as to hate it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis the entertainment of the good things of the Gospel by the will that is the principal part of your Religion. 'Tis a matter of lamentable consequence in all your lives, when there is not a sound work at the heart: how little life will there be from any truth in reading or hearing? The Fundamentals of Religion must be so received, as not only to have an old heart mended, but a new heart made. Thus understand, believe, and give up thy heart to that thou believest and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standest.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Grow downward in humility and inward in the knowledge of your selves: and above all, maintain a constant abhorrence and jealousie of the sin of pride: grow in humility, and fly from man; keep a constant apprehension of your unworthiness and weakness, of the odiousness and danger of sin, of spiritual pride: (we called because exercised about spiritual things) of being pufft up with pride of any thing in your selves, of being too confident in your selves: be low in your own, and expect not, nor desire others good thoughts of you, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lies not in humility of opinion, speech, garbe, or carriage: but in opposition to high thoughts of our own parts, gifts, godliness, when we think of these above their worth: still remember <hi>

Understand the nature of <hi>Christian watchfulness;</hi> keep up a constant resolution and courage in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, especially the temptations you carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with you, of your calling, constitution, company, and of the times; set them down, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, keep a special Observation of them all: and say, this and this it is I am in danger of; and 'tis my <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> that's in danger, and here place a special guard, and make it your business to resist. The principal cause of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans negligence in this, is the security of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and love of their sins: did you know your danger, you would better look after your safety, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Especially understand how much the <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>carnal self</hi> is an enemy to God and your souls: and how much you are engaged by the Christian Covenant to live in a <hi>warfare</hi> against your selves, and against your flesh. You must not think the life of self-pleasing is consistent with Religion: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:173109:96"/> how you are bound to take the flesh for your enemy, to watch against it, and to live in a continual combat with it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. The flesh is your chiefest enemy: the very senses themselves are all grown inordinate, and the <hi>work of faith</hi> is very much seen in its exercise this way; if you get an opinion that you may eat, and drink, and cloath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do all things to gratifie your selves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then no wonder if you find but little increase in spirituals, while you grow so carnal. Understand and practise the duty of <hi>Self-denial, self is the very heart of sin:</hi> read it not under pretence of <hi>liberty</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. Give not way to a <hi>formal, heartless, seeming Religiousness, Customariness,</hi> without the life: but keep your souls in a continual seriousness and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenedness about God, immortality, and your great concernments. If duty be dead, take heed lest that incline you to a deadness in another, and so grow to a customary deadness. Take heed of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual slothfulness, that makes you keep your hands in your bosom, when you should be doing for your souls: stir up to, and in duty, when you have but little time for life eternal: do not pray as if you prayed not, or hear as though you heard not: but when upon duty, doing Gods service, do it with all the seriousness and rigour you can; To grow lazie and negligent is the declining way: use such considerations as may stir you up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.</p>

Be not much troubled at it if you cannot please all: the bawlings of the malicious should not disturb a soul that is quietly housed with God: that soul is not well stablished in faith that can be so disturb'd and distempered by the wrath or words of malicious men.

Use often to think seriously before-hand, what death is; what thoughts, what tryals death will put a man upon: what temptations usually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our approaching death: what you shall most need at such a time as that: what thoughts are likeliest to possess you then: what you are likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to wish for when you must needs die, about spending your time, expending your estate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ask your selves, what will I wish I had done or been when I come to die? Think what will be most dreadful to a dying man, for thus you have time to escape his judgement: will it not be to think on a life lost in vanity, drench'd in worldliness, unreconciled to God, or at least in utter uncertainty of his love? God hath not foreshewed what will be a dying mans terror, to torment thee, but to get out that terror; that which will be most terrible at death, conquer and destroy it presently. <hi>They that were ready went in with the Bridegroom, and the door was shut,</hi> (Matth. 25.10.)

                  <p>Thus having given you twenty Directions, I shall reduce all to these eight Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do not think strength of grace will be got with ease: you must do that, that in other things is done for the attaining of strength, increase and confirmation. A man cannot attain knowledge in Law, Physick, or any Art, without studying, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, unwearied labour and patience, through that time that is necessary to attain it. Set your selves to the reading of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and other good books study good truths think not to attain mastery in a day: And if ever such a conceit come in your minds, that you are strong confirmed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, do not easily entertain it: there must be time, industry and diligence: ordinarily suspect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit you may have of strength and confirmation; you must grow by degrees: Gods method is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin like a grain of <hi>Mustard-seed:</hi> we are not born men: labour in the proper meanes with patience: infused gifts are given according to the manner of acquiring them: God gives as if our acquisition did attain it: never think of having this without patience, labour and diligence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Grow up in the Church of God, and under his Officers, and Ordinances, and among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Do not transplant your selves from the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vineyard of the Lord, if you will thrive: no prospering in the Commons where weeds will choak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Keep within the Church of God, in the communion of his People, among his Servants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:173109:100"/> the guidance of his Ministers, for that is the duty of Ministers to bring up, train up, and help the weak ones, till they grow to be strong: they are to be Gods Nurses, and helpers of the weak in the House of God: Do not think to prosper by breaking over the hedge, under pretence of any right of holinesse whatsoever, following any party that would draw you to separation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Make it, amongst others, the pricipal study of your lives, to <hi>study the love of God in the Redeemer,</hi> the nature of the new Covenant, and the infinite goodnesse revealed in the face of a Mediator: how it was his design to attract the hearts of men to the love of God, by revealing his infinite love in the Redeemer, unto which end Christ came for, even to represent Gods goodnesse in sinners hearts, of their being reconciled to him, and ravishing them with his love. Study the glory and ravishing love of God, and unspeakable goodnesse in a Redeemer.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Live not by sense, or upon worldly hopes, nor in the exercise of it: See that you live a mortified life: take heed of glutting your selves with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or letting our hearts out to any creature, or letting any creature be to dear to you: live not too much on any sensible thing, or upon any worldly hopes or expectations. Shut your eyes to the world: let not your desires run out to the world, and live as much as you can upon the world to come.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let holy self-suspition alwayes make you fearful of temptation and keep you out of the Devils way: Would you keep your standing, grow better and strong in grace? let not the pride of your
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:173109:100"/> hearts, or confidence of your strength, make you meet among any unlawful communion, see any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing spectacle, or thrust your selves upon tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: you are never safe if you thrust your selves upon temptation: think with your self, my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is great, I must not gaze upon this inticing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, lest my heart take fire; I am not so strong as to be able to stand against such, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. When you cannot attain unto that heat of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection you would, <hi>be sure you walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God:</hi> sin not wilfully: keep your garments clean: set his Law before your eyes: sin not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for a world: be but found in the way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and God will blesse you, and meet you in that way: be as exact in obedience, as if you had that frame of soul you desire.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In a special manner keep all your bodily sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and desires in subjection; mortifie the flesh, keep under your carnal desires in a due subjection to the Spirit; let none of your senses take the reines out of your hands: keep a dominion over your senses.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, All your life long be longing to die: let the work of your life be to learn to dye. Consider what necessity to the safety and comfort of death, to consider frequently, <hi>what assaults will be made upon dying men,</hi> that you may every day fortifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, to consider what graces and duties will be most needful and useful then, that you may be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:173109:101"/> most conversing with and exercising those graces and duties. Hee that hath well learn'd to die, is no weak Christian. The strength of your grace lies in the exercise of these things; faithfully practise them▪ and you will stand when others fall; you will have comfort, when others cast away their comfort; you will die in peace, when others die in horror.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle in this excellent Chapter (that by some is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly called, a little Book of Martyrs) discovers the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Faith, or victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all difficulty we meet with:</p>
                  <p>First, Faith it assents to Truths be they never so improbable.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:173109:102"/>
                  <p>Secondly, It puts men upon Duties, be they never so irrational, or against carnal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It enables to sufferings, be they never so afflictive. These Worthies went through all by the victory that overcame the world, the bitterness as well as the sweetnesse thereof.</p>
                  <p>In these Verses the Apostle doth two things: First, He sets down the greatness and smartnesse of their sufferings, which are by some Learned men reduced to three Heads:</p>
                  <p>First, Those sufferings that were to tempt them, and draw them from God, by those pains and tortures they were to undergo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Those sufferings they underwent in dying.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Their sufferings in regard of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and leaving their comforts, rather then they would lose God.</p>
                  <p>There were all kind of persecutions laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Saints, through all which they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and never would be brought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake God and his truth, for any of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:173109:102"/>2. We have here the excellency of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, and that is in that expression, <hi>These men,</hi> or <hi>these persons,</hi> when they were under all these distresses from the world, yet they were such of whom the world was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, The excellency of these Saints and servants of God is considerable two wayes, that we may proceed distinctly and clearly.</p>
                  <p>First, In reference to the wicked, their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was so great that the wicked world was not worthy of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their excellency is discovered from the estimate, or judgment that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle passes upon them, who tells us, that he accounted them to be such, though they were under such distresses and troubles, yet they were a people of whom the world was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
                  <p>I shall fall upon the due estimation the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostle raises upon these persecuted Saints, who was enlightned by the Spirit of God, and so was able to passe a right sentence upon these persecuted Saints; from this I raise this ensuing Observation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> That a godly man doth see a very great worth and excellency in the people of God in the midst of all their troubles and distresses; <hi>Or,</hi> That a godly man, a gracious heart, one that hath spiritual Spectacles, does see an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and worth in the people of God, in the midst of all trouble and persecution that can befall them.</p>
                  <p>Here I shall handle it first doctrinally accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my constant method, then come to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it by way of Application. For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal handling of it, there are two things must be discovered;</p>
                  <p>First, Wherein the high estimation of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart does appear, wherein it doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it self, wherein they shew they have such an high estimation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whence it is, and how it comes to pass, that godly men have this high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable esteem of the Saints and people of God in their troubles and distresses which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them.</p>
                  <p>For the first, Wherein the high estimation of a gracious heart does appear, I shall shew it in five or six following particulars.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:173109:103"/>
                  <p>First, It appears in this, In that they are not ashamed of owning their persons and faith, that they profess in their troubles and distresses; the society of the people of God, and the fellowship of the Faith and profession, is highly respected by a gracious heart, let the Saints lye under never so great distresses. This is manifest in <hi>Moses</hi> in the 25. and 26, Verses of this Chapter, <hi>He chose rather to suffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the people of God, then to injoy all the pleasure and preferment of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Court.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> Religion, the profession of the true God, and owning the faith and those Truths the <hi>Israelites</hi> stood up for, this was that which <hi>Moses</hi> would not desert: and thence it was he did not desert their company and society, but went and visited them when they lay under those burthens under which they lay.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second thing wherein is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered so high an estimation of the Saints and people of God in sufferings, is their sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing, and fellow-feeling with them in their sufferings; if it goes ill with the Church and people of God, all the rest sympathizes with them; if one member suffers, all the rest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Instance, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (who had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est favour of the greatest Prince then on earth) he look'd with a sad countenance, because of the sufferings of the Saints and people of God,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:173109:104"/>
                     <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Wherefore the King said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid, and answered the King, Because of the distresses the people of God lye under:</hi> The pleasure of Musick should never be with him, sayes <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 137.6. <hi>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem above my chief joy.</hi> As it is with two strings in an instrument rightly tuned, if one be touched, the other trembles; if one servant of Christ be in a suffering condition, the rest suffers with him: this is the damp of all worldly delight, if it be ill with any of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, the rest suffer in the way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that they can plead for them, and take their parts, when they are never so much out of favour, when they are never so much despised and abused: This was in the case of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> how hee pleaded for poor <hi>David</hi> before his cruel father <hi>Saul,</hi> though <hi>Saul</hi> called him a cursed son, and fell foul on his Mother because of him. See this in the case of <hi>Esther,</hi> though it was death to go in to the King, to plead for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> yet for all this shee sayes, <hi>If I perish, I perish;</hi> resolved I am, come what will come of it, in I will go, I can die, but I cannot be silent.</p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:173109:104"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, In that they will relieve them, and help, and supply them with all needful good things they can; if they cannot do what they would, they will do for them what they can. See this in the case of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 38. verse 8, 11, 12.13. <hi>Ebedmelech went forth out of the Kings house, and spake to the King—: So</hi> Ebedmelech <hi>took the men with him, and went into the house of the King, under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts, and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dungeon to</hi> Jeremiah. <hi>And</hi> Ebedme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech <hi>the Ethiopian said unto</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>Put now these old cast clouts, and rotten rags under thine arm holes under the cords. And</hi> Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah <hi>did so. So they drew up</hi> Jeremiah <hi>with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon, and</hi> Jeremiah <hi>remained in the Court of the prison.</hi> He would never be quiet till hee had got the Prophet out of the dungeon, and though the cords were lined with rags, yet more with love: and this favour of <hi>Ebedme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> God remembred. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. <hi>Obadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> master was not onely an oppressor of the Saints and Prophets of God, but a very great persecutor: This good man <hi>Obadiah</hi> took and hid <hi>an hundred Prophets of the Lord, and fed them with bread and water</hi> (I will not undertake to prophesie to you this day, yet time may come, when bread and water may bee good food for a faithful Prophet.)</p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:173109:105"/>
                  <p>Here note the gracious disposition of good <hi>Obadiah,</hi> as well as the providence of God in this act. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>The Lord give mercy unto the house</hi> Onesiphorus, <hi>for he oft refreshed me, and was not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of my chaine. But when he was in</hi> Rome, <hi>he sought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him, that he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things hee ministred unto me at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>thou knowest very well.</hi> A most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Scripture to this purpose. Blessed <hi>Paul</hi> being thrown into prison, being in bonds, <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> often refresh'd him, and was not ashamed of his chaines: How did he shew this? When he was in <hi>Rome,</hi> he sought him out diligently.</p>
                  <p>By the way note, That <hi>Rome</hi> was the place where the cruel <hi>Nero</hi> was Emperour, it was the place where much blood of the Martyrs was spilt, yet there this good man sought out <hi>Paul</hi> diligently. Mark what follows, which is the prayer of <hi>Paul, The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I profess Sirs, I had rather have the prayers of <hi>Paul▪</hi> then the preferments of the greatest Court on earth: Christians, it is the greatest treasure in your house, to have the prayers of good men to God for you: You that have shewn your
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:173109:105"/> great and abundant love to the Saints and Servants of God in distress: I do from my soul beg the like mercy for you, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you have done for his, may be ten thousand times made up by him, that you may find mercy in that day, and truely Sirs, in that day mercy will be worth recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They supplicate to God for them, they do not go to the Throne of Grace for themselves, but <hi>Sion</hi> is in their thoughts. I am confident it is so with some, and am perswaded it is so with all; they never beg daily bread for themselves, but they remember <hi>Sion:</hi> In the 51 Psalm, <hi>David</hi> was under trouble of Conscience, soul-trouble, which is the soul of trouble, yet at the latter end of the 51 Psalme he breaks out into this earnest supplication to God, <hi>Do good in thy good pleasure unto Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, build thou up the walls of</hi> Jerusalem: So long as it is ill with the people of God, so long they are earnest with God; and though they cannot overcome men with their prayers (which by the way they are to endeavour) yet they will never leave supplicating the Almighty, till they have overcome. As the sufferings of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are precious in the sight of God,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:173109:106"/> so they are in the sight of the people of God.</p>
                  <p>I come now to shew whence it is, That there is such an high esteem in the people of God, of the people of God, when under trouble and distress; for this take two Heads of Reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, In regard of those of the people of God that do behold their sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In regard of those people of God that are in sufferings.</p>
                  <p>First, In regard those of the people of God, that do behold their sufferings, troubles and distresses, in three regards.</p>
                  <p>First, Those of the people of God that look upon others in trouble, though they are such as may differ from them, in regard of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate; one may be in honour, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in dishonour, yet they have an interest in the same head, and do belong to the same body that they do; they are not wooden leggs, nor glasse eyes; therefore Christ is called the Common Saviour, and the Saviour of the body, the whole Church: Faith it is called, the <hi>like precious faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 ch. in the beginning: <hi>to them that have obtained like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:173109:106"/> Faith,</hi> &amp;c. The faith of one believer does as truely lay hold on Christ, as the faith of another. This salvation is called common salvation: my meaning is, this outward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion, as to birth and education, puts no difference at all in a spiritual respect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween believer and believer: a King and a Beggar, all one in Christ; a <hi>Iew</hi> or a <hi>Greek,</hi> a great Scholar, or a poor ignorant man, as to the spiritual state, all one, made happy the same way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because they look at Spiritual excellency, and are able to discern spiritual excellency; they have a renewed Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they look upon their old courses and sinnes with a new eye, so they look upon their company with a new eye: those that before they highly esteem'd, they now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem: those persons that before they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd a damp to their mirth, they now look upon them as the excellent ones of the earth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>The righteous is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than his neighbour.</hi> In the 16 Psalme, sayes <hi>David, My goodnesse extends not to thee, but to the Saints; the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.</hi> Here was a renewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation, <hi>David</hi> saw excellency in these which worldlings despised. A carnal eye sees no glory but in carnal objects; Worldlings blesse the Covetous, whom the Lord abhorrs.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:173109:107"/> A gracious heart sees a spiritual worth in a man divested of worldly enjoyments, as a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eye may, and does see a great deal of Art and Curiosity in a picture, though in a broken frame. A Beast can see the shining of a Diamond, but knowes not the worth of it; a beast will rather lick up a lock of Hay, then a Diamond, though of never so great value. A wicked man wants a spirit of discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The people of God are the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of God, which a godly man is very much taken withall; not with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but with the goodnesse that is in them. The four Monarchs of the earth are exprest by four beasts, which shewes their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not their curiosity, in observing that of God which may be observed. A child is taken with the Gay, but a Learned man is taken with the Learning, and Art of a lesson.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A child of God, is one that highly esteemes the people of God, judging of them as God judges. The child esteems as the father esteems: if the father cannot love any one, the ingenious child cannot endure that he should come into the house. The Courtier followes the favorite of the King; whom the King honours, they cringe to. But to be sure it is true as to spirituals: God judges not by the gold ring, or silken shute; a sinner is a vile person in Gods
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:173109:107"/> account, and so he is in a godly mans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; God is more taken with a broken-hearted sigh, than with all the gaudery in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Temple. He did not chuse the Eagle, or the Lion for sacrifice, but the Lamb and the Dove: not many noble, not many rich, but the poor hath God chosen: He that hath the life of God, he hath the love of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. <hi>Reason,</hi> Is from the people of God that are beheld. This will appear in five or six par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>First, The people of God, those that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, let their present condition be what it will, their end shall be happy. Men are not regarded in reference to what they have in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, but what they shall have in reversion: the poor here are rich in faith, and shall be rich in glory. 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> The people of God are Heires of glory, coheires with Christ; when he shall appear, they shall appear with him in Glory: they are not possessors here, but they are Heires, and are to be look'd upon as what they shall be hereafter: Here they are Princes going to their Crown, hereafter they shall be possessed of it: Here they may be oppressed, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, disgrac'd, libell'd, hereafter they shall shine as the Sun in Glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are not onely such as shall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173109:108"/> be happy, but they are very useful and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in the world, they are those for whose sake the world was made, they are the great common blessings of the world, like fire and water, they are those for whose sake God spares the world. If God would have spared the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ten righteous persons sakes, surely for many tens God spares the world; those that are pull'd down by the world, are those for whose sake God doth not pull down the world, they are the soul of the world, as I may so say; If God had gathered in all his Elect, the world would not continue one hour longer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The excellency of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances is highly esteemed, there is a worth in every holy Work, that World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are not able to discern; Every Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Prayer, and sincerely bestowed Almes, hath a worth that a carnal eye does not see: <hi>Luther</hi> sayes, <hi>I had rather do the least truly good work, than obtain all the Conquests of</hi> Caesar <hi>and</hi> Alexander. If their good works shall be so rewarded, do you think a holy man can see them, and not be taken with them? Many a wicked man when hee heares a holy man make an excellent Oration, wishes that hee could do so too: it is not from the goodnesse hee observes in it, or the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from whence it comes, but from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:173109:108"/> of natural accomplishments that he is taken with it: so a godly man when hee heares another pray excellently, and live holily, hee wishes from his heart that hee could do so too: his aim is to grow in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The present priviledges of the people of God, not onely what they shall have hereafter, but what they have here, they are freed from a world of evils, that Worldlings lye under, whatever befalls them turns to their benefit; they may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but not hurt by affliction; the greatest hurt the world does to them, tends to their greatest good; Worldlings may take away their Heads, they cannot take their Crown: There is a real communication of a blessed interest in all that is good, for they have an interest in all that God hath, or is: The power of God is theirs, to protect them, the love of God is set upon them, the righteousnesse of God imputed to them, so as to acquit them from sin; so that a childe of God may not onely appeal to the bowels of Gods mercy, but to the barr of Justice: all the providences of God shall tend to their good: In the 25th. Psalme, about the 10th. Verse, the Holy Ghost sayes, <hi>All the wayes of God are Mercy and Truth, to them that are in Covenant with him;</hi> they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173109:109"/> are Mercy, because they are appointed to do them good; and Truth, because they shall certainly do them good: Christ, and God, and all is laid out for the good of a godly man. In this world they may go to God, and tell him wherein they are troubled, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or afflicted, and they are never more welcome to him, then when they ask most from him; if thou askest great things from God, God is well taken with such requests, but if thou askest Riches and Honours, these are the low things of the Foot-stool: God is exceedingly taken with thee, when thou ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Peace and Pardon, Peace of Conscience, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, Strength against Sin, power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy Lusts, to withstand Temptations. The people of God may have from God all that they want, and all they can regularly wish.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, These are such as have an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dear and near relation to God, they are his delight, they are set apart by God as his own, his peculiar people; though God have a propriety in all, yet he hath a peculiar propriety in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to these; therefore they are called his Children, his House, his Jewels, his Garden; Gods whole Treasure and Portion is his people; as God is his peoples portion, so his people are his portion, they are those that he hath been at a great deal of cost to purchase.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:173109:109"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:173109:110"/>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:173109:110"/>6thly. They are such as have the Image of God imprinted upon them, take notice of this word Image, for the Image of God appears in Holinesse; Now an Image does not represent any thing of imperfection or deformity, but of Excellency. If a man takes the Picture of a man, he will not take it of his backside, Leg, or Hand, or the like, but of his Face, his beautifullest part is chiefly aimed at in the Picture; Wicked men discover Gods bounty in having wit and wealth, this is not the Image of God, the Image of God is that which is most excellent in a man, which is Holinesse: The power of God is the Hand of God, the Wisedome of God is the Eye of God, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of God is the Face, the Beauty of God, the people of God resemble God in Purity, <hi>Be ye Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as your Heavenly Father is Holy,</hi> there's the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, they have the Divine Nature, 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</hi> Ephes. 4.18. <hi>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the blindnesse of their heart.</hi> Rom. 3 23 <hi>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</hi> There is more of God in Grace, then in all the works that ever God did in the World besides; There is much of God seen in making the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but in giving a man a new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a renewed understanding, in changing of a man from being a Vessel of wrath, and Vassal of Sathan, in making of him became a new man, a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:173109:111"/> Vessel of Glory; God shews more of himself then in making ten thousand worlds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse.</hi> Here I shall raise these following Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: If it be so that there is such an excellency in the people of God here, then first, what excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy shall there be seen on the people of God in Heaven? If they are so beautifull in their rags, what will they be when they appear in their Robes? The Glory of Christ shall be admired in them that believe. Oh what a Head is he that hath such members? What a Lord is he that hath such Attendance? The people of God are in a state of Non-appearance now, hereafter it shall appear what they are, the very wicked themselves shall admire them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Inference.</hi> What are we to think of those that have no regard either for Religion, or for Religious ones, any farther forth then it is deckt and adorn'd with advantagious Beauty and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Glory? If Religion be not lookt upon with a favourable Eye from Authority, farewell Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Religiousnesse. These love the Child for the Nurses sake, what is the thing in fashion these are for, what Authority commands they'le creep and cringe to; When the Dear is shot, the Heard flies from her, when Religion is shot at, then farewell Religion; what is this but to have the Faith of God in respect of Persons? If I love Religion for the countenance of Authority, then it is certain I love Religion for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities sake; This is a sign thou shalt not have communion with those hereafter that thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnest here: If the people of God are too bad
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:173109:111"/> for thee when they are in trouble and affliction, they will be too good for thee in Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Inference.</hi> Note here the excellency of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse above Wordly Glory; Here a man is digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by what is conferr'd upon him, when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Honour ceaseth, the man is contemned, but Holinesse it dignifies a man, and shall remain here and hereafter; Set a Gyant in a valley he is a Gyant still; a Pearl is a Pearl though on a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; a Holy man is a Holy man though never so much disgrast and contemned by men: <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> had a Leathern Girdle, and had Locust for his food, yet there was not a greater then <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> born of Women; He was the forerunner of Christ, the Friend of the Bridegroom; on the other side <hi>Herod,</hi> that was like the Voyce of God, and not of man, what was he in Gods account? The Angel smote him and he became Worms meat. There is a silent dignity in reproached piety, and a silent ignominy in advanced iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: As it was with Christ, so it is with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ; When he was on Earth no man had more ignominy poured upon him, yet there was a secret Glory attended him in all that befell him; though Born in a Manger, yet Worshipped there, sometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he was driven to be hungry, the Fish brought him money, sometimes a weary, at that very time converts a Woman, sometimes laid hold on by his Enemies, at that very time his Enemies fell down before him; Look through the whole course of his life, there was a secret glory under all ignominy: Just thus it is with the Servants of Christ, they are in trouble and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:173109:112"/> disgrace, but there is a secret Glory and dignity shines in them, the Spirit of God and of Glory rests upon them; If ye suffer for righteousnesse sake, blessed are ye; to be in high place and yet to be a Drunkard, or a Swearer, or a Whoremaster, or Prophane, this spoyles all thy glory, be thou never so high.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Inference.</hi> This is the way for a man to have a good name; wouldst thou gain a good report living and dying? Take heed of sin, take heed of dishonouring God, then God will have thee in everlasting remembrance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Inference.</hi> Note here the certain happinesse of these beholders, that do see certain excellency in Holinesse, though disgrast and undervalued; if there be any thing in the world that is a sign of sincerity it is this, to love Holinesse, when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grast, abused, and spit upon; to crosse the stream, and thwart the multitude, is a sign of the truth of Grace, and strength of Grace: This is a sign of a true fight, and strong fight. To see beauty in a Godly man in sufferings, the Lord will certainly have an eye upon thee in times of troubles; Here is comfort in thine infirmities. Dost thou love Holinesse when compassed about with sufferings and persecution? God will take notice of thy Grace, though compassed about with abundance of infirmities; the Lord will take notice of a little of his, in a great deal of ours: Here's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in sufferings: If you regard his in their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Lord will remember you in your suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Lord will remember what thou didst for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and such a Servant of his in trouble or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:173109:112"/> God doth not cast away any in their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that have kept close to him in their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and this will be comfort in inward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when thou canst find nothing from which to fetch comfort. And this will be comfort in the last day, though we can say nothing in that day by way of merit, yet it will be comfort to be able sincerely to say, that thou hast owned God and his people in the midst of sufferings: Do ye think that Judge would not save that Malefactor that had saved the life of his Wife? If thou hast own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ when he was in his Rags, do not fear but he will own thee when he comes in his Robes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Inference,</hi> and last, The People of God should learn not to be discouraged under any misery or affliction that can befall them in this world; at this very time God hath a high esteem of you; At this time you are his delight, his Garden, his Spouse. The Saints of God are the wisemen of the world, they have chosen that which cannot be taken from them: I profess Sirs, the love of one Saint makes amends for all the hatred you undergo from sinners, the very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves have a good opinion of you, when you do not basely comply, their Consciences cannot but have an high esteem of you, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure their tongues might speak against you. If all this will not do, remember your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are more then a thousand witnesses, for you will then comfort you; No man is a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man for any thing in the world that is done to him, or said of him; No, it is a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:173109:113"/> that will give the best acquittance; for thee to have the whole number of Gods people to look upon thee as an unworthy wretch, and as a vile person, I look upon it as a greater ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and disgrace, then to have all the disgraces of wicked men cast upon thee: That man that hath a Godly man to be afraid of him, had need to be very much afraid of himself. I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with this one word, There is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to look narrowly to your hearts and wayes, when they stand at a distance from you, and are afraid to come near you.</p>

                  <p>LET us take a short view of the fore-going Verses; and that this may be the more usefull and profitable to us, we may take notice, That as in the former Chapter there is described <hi>Moses</hi>'s preservation to his future em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:173109:114"/> so in this Chapter there is described his preparation, and his fitting for that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a <hi>Vision,</hi> or rather a suitable <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in which God discovered unto <hi>Moses</hi> his care of the people, of whom <hi>Moses</hi> was to be a speedy deliverer: You have here in the words read unto you the preparation afforded to <hi>Moses</hi> for the great work, of being call'd to be <hi>Israel's</hi> deliverer, and in this preparation you may take notice of these three principal parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>Apparition</hi> that is here presented to the view of <hi>Moses, A burning, though not a consumed Bush.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Moses</hi> care to observe it, <hi>I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the Bush is not burned.</hi> And then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Gods Monitory Precept, or Admonition, which he afforded unto <hi>Moses,</hi> when he was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to see this wonder, in which we have principally considerable two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Precept propounded, 1. Negatively, <hi>That he should not draw near.</hi> 2. Affirmatively, <hi>That he should put off his shoes from off his feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. You have considerable the Reason or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, whereby God doth back this Precept or Admonition, <hi>i. e. Because that place whereon he stood was holy ground.</hi> The time would sail me if I should go over all these parts, we shall only touch on the two former, the <hi>Apparition</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> saw, and <hi>Moses</hi>'s desire to observe it, of which I shall only speak transitorily, and insist on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more fully, which I chiefly intend.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:173109:114"/>1. For the Apparition, or emblematical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the estate of the Church in the <hi>burning,</hi> and yet <hi>unconsumed bush.</hi> And herein take notice of three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The lownesse and weaknesse of the <hi>Church,</hi> represented by a <hi>Bush.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>cruelties</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> enemies, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd and represented by <hi>Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The eminency of its preservation, though in the <hi>fire,</hi> yet <hi>unconsumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this only take notice, that the <hi>Church</hi> is compared to a <hi>bush</hi> for two reasons; 1 In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its deformity and blacknesse, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. 2, In regard of its weaknesse and brittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The Church is uncomly in regard of sin, and weak in regard of suffering, and God sees it best that it should be thus with them to humble them, and to shew his goodnesse to accept them, and to love them, and make them long for their future beauty; and hereby God makes them more conformable to their Head, hereby he makes them endeavour to look after inward beauty and glory; hereby he puts them on a life of faith, and takes them off from living by sense, and creature comforts, and from being entangled with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comfort. And hereby he shows how little he regards the beauty and glory of this life, which he denies to the best of his people: And hereby he shows, that there is a better state of appearance and glory approaching; and therefore the people of God are not to be censured under their black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and deformity, either in regard of sin or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:173109:115"/> their happinesse is not to be judg'd by its outward appearance, because this life is but the obscurity of the Church; we see them like the <hi>Tents of Kedar,</hi> but we do not see how like the <hi>Curtains of Solomon they shall be.</hi> 2. The people of God should take heed of expecting that glory of this world, which is not promised to them, and to set their hearts on Heaven. And you may see the reason, why wicked men stumble so much at the <hi>outside</hi> of God's Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ship, because there is no <hi>outward bravery and beauty</hi> to allure them to the true Worship.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Church is compared to a <hi>Bush,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its <hi>weaknesse</hi> and <hi>brittlenesse.</hi> Note, That it is not compar'd to a strong sturdy Oke, but to a weak brittle Bush. God loves to bring his Church into a low and weak estate and condition; as it is here compared to a <hi>Bush,</hi> so other-where to a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Dove,</hi> a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and a <hi>Sheep,</hi> all weak crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Sometimes the Church is said to be father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and destitute; and as our Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of the Church, was said to be <hi>weak, a worm and no man;</hi> and as the <hi>Apostle</hi> said, <hi>Suffered through weaknesse.</hi> And this makes them to trust in God, and puts them to rest on his strength; <hi>When we are weak, then are we strong;</hi> outward <hi>weaknesse</hi> will make us look the more to Christ for <hi>spiritual strength;</hi> the weaknesse of our state doth shew the spiritual strength God gives to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the upholding of them. And this w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Church doth exceedingly confound his enemies, when so weak a company shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:173109:115"/> not only <hi>against,</hi> but <hi>by</hi> the strength of men; and hereby God doth gain to himself the greater glory in their deliverance, for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them in their weak estate. Hereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are made the more thankfull, both for their preservation <hi>in,</hi> and deliverence <hi>from</hi> their powerfull adversaries. You see, here is a large field opened unto me, for the discoursing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church's weaknesse, which, whether it be more suitable to the <hi>Text,</hi> or to the <hi>Times,</hi> I leave to you to judge. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider the <hi>cruelty</hi> of their <hi>opposition:</hi> that is set forth and represented <hi>by the fire that burned in the Bush. Afflictions,</hi> and especially <hi>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>secuting</hi> ones, are in Scripture frequently set out by <hi>fire,</hi> as, <hi>The fiery tryal, the fire of Affliction.</hi> This doth not only discover the <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> of men, but also the benefit and utility that comes to the Church by Affliction; for the Afflictions of the Church are not as <hi>consuming,</hi> but <hi>trying fire;</hi> as the fire in a Furnace is to Gold, it only takes away the drosse; not like the fire of <hi>hell,</hi> which hath <hi>heat</hi> without <hi>light,</hi> but the <hi>School</hi> of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution hath <hi>light</hi> as well as <hi>heat;</hi> the School of Affliction is the School of teaching, God teacheth his Saints excellent Lessons by the light of that fire. But I passe by that. I might now insist upon the third thing.—</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider the <hi>eminence</hi> of their preservation, <hi>It was not consumed;</hi> the Church of God was <hi>hot,</hi> but not altogether and wholly <hi>consumed;</hi> let the fire be never so hot and spreading, the Church of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:173109:116"/> God shall have a <hi>being;</hi> if the Church be lesse in one place, it will be greater in another; what it loses in one place, it gets in another; and God will have a Name among his people on earth: A man may as well attempt to blow out the light of the Sun with a pair of bellows, or batter it with snow-balls, as to root the Church out of the world; for it is impossible to root Christ's Church out of the world. And if you take notice of particular Believers, <hi>it is not consumed,</hi> in a way of hurting and destroying them; and consider, their graces are not consumed, their welfare is not destroyed; this fire cannot burn them <hi>up,</hi> though it burn <hi>upon</hi> them; But as he will mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and allay the fire, so as that it shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their strength, so he will cleanse his people by the fire, so as that it shall burn up nothing but their drosse, and what makes them offensive unto God, and what may make them hurtful one to another. But I passe by these things to the second general Part, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Moses care</hi> to observe God's admonition, <hi>That he would turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush was not burn▪ Moses</hi> was an excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalist, and yet here he was posed; he could see no reason in nature by all the learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> how this thing should come to passe, that a flaming <hi>fire</hi> should be in a brittle <hi>bush,</hi> and yet the <hi>bush</hi> not <hi>consumed:</hi> And yet I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (as some Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uitical Expositors upon the place do) that <hi>Moses</hi> did turn aside so much out of <hi>curiosity,</hi> as to <hi>understand</hi> what it was that God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:173109:116"/> did intend by it, and would have him to learn by it. And doubtlesse when God's wotks are great, our observations should not be small; when his providence is eminently lifted up, we should not be cast down; when the hand of God is upon us, we must not shut our eyes. I am very far from being a Phanatique, and to give credit or be led by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural revelations; but yet let me tell you, the times wherein we live are strange times, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>strange sights</hi> and <hi>apparitions,</hi> and I question if there have not been <hi>some</hi> as wonderfull as <hi>this</hi> in our times, but I shall not now mention them; though it be a forfeiture of your modesty to give a reason for them, yet they do portend some strange things; the hand of God is not to be neglected, though it cannot be perfectly conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is the nature of a wicked man to have <hi>Gods works far out of his sight;</hi> be sure to lay them up in <hi>your</hi> hearts: And thus far you may take notice of them, To trust that God that hath all the Elementary <hi>Meteors</hi> in his power, and at his command; and this <hi>learn,</hi> to tremble and dread before that God that hath you in his power, and can do with you and all other things as he pleases.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You have here considerable the Admonition of God, or the Monitory Precept God lays down to <hi>Moses, i. e.</hi> he forbids him to <hi>draw nigher,</hi> and then bids him <hi>to pull off his shoes:</hi> the reason of the <hi>former</hi> will be easily understood in the opening of the <hi>latter;</hi> I shall therefore in it briefly take notice of two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:173109:117"/>1. An Injunction, <hi>Put off thy shoes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Argument whereby he doth back this, <hi>Because the place whereon he stood was holy ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the opening of the former, the Injunction, <hi>Put off thy shoes,</hi> I shall not give the divers glosses and divers Interpretations which men, with more <hi>wit</hi> then <hi>weight,</hi> have endeavoured to make of this Scripture; the plain meaning is this, which is given us by <hi>Theodoret, Put off thy shoes,</hi> God's scope, and drift, and intent hereby was, to require of <hi>Moses</hi> reverence, when he was to receive a Message of very great concernment and importance about his Church; the design of God was in this to prepare him to obedience, therefore God requires that of him then, which servants were wont to do when they came to their Lord and Master, to shew their reverence to them, servants used to come bare-foot to their Master, to testifie reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the commands of them on whom they waited: <hi>Nudare pedes signum reverentiae.</hi> And the <hi>putting on the shoes</hi> is in Scripture, as well as among other Writers, held as a token of domination or masterly power. Hence some conceive, <hi>John</hi> spake of <hi>Christ</hi> as one that had his <hi>shoes</hi> on; and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as one that was unworthy to unty his <hi>shoes.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> by a sign of <hi>putting off his shoes,</hi> is commanded by God to put off his shoes from off his feet, and to walk naked and bare-foot; and he did so, <hi>Isa.</hi> 20.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth the <hi>servility</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> in token that God's people were to be in a low condition in captivity. So we read of <hi>Mourners</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel, chap.</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:173109:117"/> 24.17. <hi>that were of a low spirit,</hi> they are said <hi>to go without shoes,</hi> or <hi>unsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d.</hi> And, my brethren, on the other side, when God would show the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his people, and their deliverance from servitude, he is said to <hi>put shoes on their feet,</hi> Ezech. 16.10. And the reception of the <hi>Prodigal</hi> into his Fathers house, and the freedom and previledge his Father intended him, (according to some learned men, intended by that expression in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.22.) is set forth by <hi>putting on shoes</hi> upon his <hi>feet.</hi> So that I take the meaning of this <hi>command</hi> to be so much; Shew by this thy reverence, thy humility, thy due submissiveness, thy subjection of spirit, together with thy servile readiness to do whatsoever I shall command thee. <hi>Calvin</hi> hath this Note upon the <hi>Text,</hi> If so excellent a servant of God as <hi>Moses</hi> had need to be quickened to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and obedience by such a ceremony, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we that are more backward to humility and obedience, should by our reverent behaviour, when we come into the presence of God, signifie both the reverence of our souls by our outward expressions, and likewise quicken and fortifie the inward graces of our souls by the outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of the body, (especially in prayer) as kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lifting up the hands, uncovering of the head, and the like: for the presence of God is <hi>great,</hi> and it's the presence of the <hi>great</hi> God indeed; we that are not only by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi> so <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely below</hi> him, but also in regard of that illegal Law of sin, so much against him, should testifie our <hi>humility</hi> before him, and <hi>subjection</hi> to him,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:173109:118"/> when he calls for it by our reverence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reason by which this is backt, <hi>Because the place whereon Moses did stand was holy ground.</hi> The meaning I take to be this, It is holy in regard of that visible and miraculous <hi>token, symbol,</hi> and <hi>sign</hi> of my presence, that is here discovered in this place; not because the place was (as I do not understand how any place is) of its own nature holy, but God did testifie, that that place being the place of his special presence, had thereby a holinesse, there being now a sign given by <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> that he was extraordinarily and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously there. And thus I have opened the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Branch, whereon this Injunction was backt, <hi>This place was holy;</hi> so it was <hi>then.</hi> Now I do not understand how I can discourse of this so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably unto you, concerning the holinesse of places, unlesse we take notice of the holinesse of places now in the time of the Gospel, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether, and how, in these times, one place may be said to be holy or holier then another. And truly I am not put on this employment willingly, nor the handling of this subject; and if it were not extorted from me by something, I do not say that I have <hi>seen,</hi> but that I have <hi>read,</hi> that was <hi>written</hi> by men, and those none of the <hi>meanest</hi> neither, the <hi>learnedest</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi> I should not now have chosen to have entred upon this task, concerning the holinesse of places, in opposition to <hi>whom,</hi> I have entred upon this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: I will give you two expressions, which one of the <hi>devoutest,</hi> and the other of the <hi>learned'st</hi> of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:173109:118"/> them hath; the <hi>learnedest</hi> of them, accounted so at least (though, blessed be God, his weapons have not been formidable to the Church) is <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> his words are these, <hi>Templum consecran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum merito venerabile &amp; divina virtute praeditum est,</hi> The Temple consecrated is deservedly holy, and venerable in worship, and endowed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine virtue and efficacy; the Temple ought to be looked upon as honourable and venerable. And for the other, <hi>Durandus,</hi> he tells us, <hi>So great is the Religion and Holinesse of Churches, that those things should be, and may be forbidden to be done in them,</hi> (he means perpetually, or else he saith nothing, for <hi>we</hi> grant as much) <hi>which in other places may duly and lawfully be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of this Question, <hi>How we are to judge and conceive of the holinesse of places in the times of the Gospel?</hi> I shall endeavour, first, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it, and then <hi>faithfully</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> endeavour to resolve and determine the same.</p>
                  <p>First then, for <hi>Explanation,</hi> I shall here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to open these two things to you; first, what it is for a place to be <hi>holy,</hi> or wherein the natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of the <hi>holinesse</hi> of <hi>places</hi> consists: secondly, what that is that is the <hi>foundation</hi> or <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>holinesse</hi> of <hi>places,</hi> and both these must in our discourse, and likewise apprehension be accurately distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is for a <hi>place</hi> to be <hi>holy,</hi> this is two wayes to be considered; 1. generally; 2. more particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. More generally, The <hi>holinesse</hi> of a <hi>place</hi> doth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:173109:119"/> consist in the <hi>separation</hi> thereof, the setting it apart, the distinction and discrimination in the way of some excellent preheminence, or the exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it before and above all other places: Thus the notion of the holinesse of places is taken in Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.31, 37, 38. you shall there read, that the Lord tells them in the 31 verse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>oyntment</hi> that he prescribed, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>composition</hi> of it for his service, <hi>This shall be an holy anointing oyl unto me throughout your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</hi> Now see how God doth discover this to be holy, <hi>On mans flesh it shall not be poured, neither shall you make any other like it after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of it.</hi> Here was a discrimination, as well to the <hi>using</hi> of it as to the <hi>making</hi> and <hi>composition</hi> of it; as none was to <hi>make</hi> such an <hi>oyntment</hi> as this was, so none was to <hi>use</hi> it in their <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>common</hi> employment: so that now the <hi>holinesse</hi> thereof did consist in the <hi>distinction</hi> and <hi>discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of it from other <hi>uses,</hi> and likewise from all other <hi>oyntments.</hi> And this is further expressed concerning the <hi>holy perfumes</hi> in the 37 and 38 verses, there was to be a <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>this</hi> and <hi>other</hi> perfumes; and <hi>this</hi> was the <hi>holiness</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, And so you shall find it not onely concerning <hi>holy things,</hi> but likewise concerning <hi>holy persons, Levit.</hi> 20.24, 25, <hi>I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people; you shall therefore put a difference between clean beasts, and unclean.</hi> Mark ye, herein is the <hi>holinesse</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> that they were a <hi>differenced</hi> and <hi>sever'd</hi> people. And <hi>hence</hi> it is you read in <hi>Deuteronomy, chap.</hi> 26.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:173109:119"/> 18, 19. that <hi>God</hi> is there said to <hi>avouch his people,</hi> openly to discover himself to assert it <hi>that they are his people;</hi> their <hi>holinesse</hi> was a <hi>discrimination,</hi> a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> from the rest of the people. And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. and 14.2. you have there the very same things described and discovered to you. And now for this I shall desire you to take notice of comparing two places of Scripture, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the holinesse of places, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.2.7. <hi>Thou shalt separate three Cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possesse it.</hi> And at the seventh verse, <hi>Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three Cities for thee.</hi> Now you shall have this again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to you in <hi>Joshua, chap.</hi> 20.7. <hi>And they sanctifi'd Kedesh in Galilee in Napthaly, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem in mount Ephraim, and Kiriath arba (which is Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.</hi> Mark the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that that was called <hi>Separation</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.2.7. is here called <hi>Sanctification;</hi> therefore the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>And you shall sanctifie,</hi> or, <hi>make holy these places;</hi> that is, <hi>holy,</hi> by the <hi>separation</hi> of them unto that employment that I shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point: Hence a thing is said to be unholy in Scripture when it is common, is not separated and set apart to holy employments and services, and from every thing that is of a civil concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And hence you read in <hi>Act.</hi> 10.14. in the <hi>Vision</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> had, God bids <hi>Peter kill and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</hi> That that is <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>unholy,</hi> in a way of <hi>legal unholynesse,</hi> is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:173109:120"/> said to be <hi>common,</hi> not set apart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. you shall there read this notion clearly discovered to you in the New Testament, <hi>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under-foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctifi'd an unholy thing.</hi> An <hi>unholy thing</hi> is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> thing. So that now what is <hi>sanctification</hi> in the former part of the verse, is called <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monnesse</hi> and <hi>uncleannesse</hi> in the latter part. But not to give you any more instances of this nature, the <hi>general nature</hi> of <hi>holinesse</hi> is <hi>discrimination</hi> or <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To answer it more particularly, this <hi>setting apart,</hi> or <hi>discrimination,</hi> or <hi>separation</hi> of places for holy uses, must have these two properties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A place that is holy, it must have such a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from other places, as that it must be <hi>alienated</hi> from all uses but holy uses, it must not at all be employed to civil uses, for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it unto civil uses must be looked upon as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unlawfull. Thus in the Scripture, when times, things, or persons are reputed as holy, they are to be exempted from common employment; the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> a <hi>holy day, In it thou must not do any manner of work.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Ʋtensils</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> were <hi>holy,</hi> and therefore were not to be used to ordinary uses; and this, as some think, was the great sin of <hi>Belshazar,</hi> that he would offer to drink in the Vessels of the <hi>Temple.</hi> And so the <hi>garments</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> were <hi>holy,</hi> and not to be used by secular persons. And the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:173109:120"/> the <hi>Temple</hi> were <hi>holy,</hi> and not to be used in civil employments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. More particularly, concerning this holiness I desire to shew you what it is, by shewing you, it must be such a holinesse and separation, as that the <hi>service</hi> done to God in those places must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and looked upon as a better service, and more acceptable, then if so be it had been done else-where, more acceptable to God, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to our selves. Now, as places are said to be holy, in regard they are only to be for holy services, so,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Holy in regard that <hi>holy services</hi> are <hi>only</hi> to be done <hi>there,</hi> with <hi>acceptation</hi> or <hi>advantage,</hi> at least with so <hi>great acceptation.</hi> And therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to take notice, that <hi>places</hi> in Scripture were said to be <hi>holy,</hi> which did <hi>sanctifie</hi> the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> which was done in them, and sanctifie the <hi>Worshippers,</hi> and so the very places are part of worship: and so not only places <hi>in</hi> which God was worshipped, but <hi>by</hi> which God was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. And thus the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was <hi>sanctifi'd,</hi> and so the performance of Gods worship therein, made Gods service more acceptable and sanctifi'd. And so the <hi>Altar,</hi> when it was holy, it made the <hi>gift</hi> the more holy and sanctifi'd, and so the more acceptable, the <hi>Altar</hi> sanctifi'd the <hi>gift, Mat.</hi> 23.18, 19. And so the <hi>Incense</hi> was acceptable to God, as being put into such a <hi>Censer.</hi> And so the service done to God in such <hi>Garments</hi> was more acceptable, because done in them which God had <hi>instituted</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> for <hi>Aaron</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:173109:121"/> and his <hi>Sons</hi> to wear. And so I have opened the first thing in the explanation, and that is to shew you, wherein holinesse consists, and how it is that places or things may be said to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and I think I have sufficiently cleared the notion to you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To shew, what the <hi>cause</hi> or the <hi>foundation</hi> of this holinesse is; for this, my Brethren, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you also to take notice of it more generally, and then more particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. More generally, That the cause and the foundation of a <hi>place,</hi> or any other <hi>thing's</hi> holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it is its belonging to God, God's peculiar relation to <hi>it,</hi> and propriety in <hi>it,</hi> declared as he shall please: And therefore to be holy, and to be God<hi>'s,</hi> are words of the like importance, or equivolent, its being God's, and his having a relation to it, is the foundation and cause of its holinesse. And therefore if you look into <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2. you shall there find God commands, that <hi>they should sanctifie unto him all the first-born, it is mine;</hi> there now is that which is the <hi>cause,</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>ground</hi> of its being <hi>sanctified,</hi> or <hi>holy,</hi> it is <hi>God himself,</hi> God hath a propriety in it. And therefore I desire you to look into <hi>Luke</hi> 2.23. it will open this notion to you; there you shall see, that this command is again repeated, but yet in other words, and therefore he saith, <hi>As it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;</hi> that which is said in <hi>one place</hi> to be <hi>sanctifi'd</hi> or <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,</hi> is <hi>here said</hi> to be <hi>holy;</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> holy,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:173109:121"/>
                     <hi>because</hi> separated to God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30. <hi>All the Tithes of the land is the Lord's, it is holy unto the Lord;</hi> it is <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> holy <hi>because</hi> it is the Lord's. So that here is the general answer. This is the foundation, ground and cause of its holynesse, Gods peculiar propriety in it, it is the Lord's.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. More particularly, That the declared propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety that God hath in any place, or his relation to a place, or its belonging unto God, that is the foundation of its holinesse. This belonging unto God, or Gods propriety in it, is declared two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Its belonging unto God is declared,

                  <p n="1">1. By his Presence. Now the presence of God that was the foundation of the holiness of a place, was two-fold.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The Extraordinary presence of God was by his miraculous Apparitions, and discovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by some miraculous token, vision, sign, or manifestation of his presence, as now here in this <hi>burning, and not consumed Bush;</hi> here was a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous token of Gods presence.

And Joshua did so.</hi> And therefore, as I conceive, hence it is, the <hi>Mountain</hi> in which <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>transfigured,</hi> is called, <hi>The holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>

And remember this place now, of Gods extraordinary miraculous manifestation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the <hi>Bush,</hi> was <hi>holy</hi> for that time, and no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. As the presence of God w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s extraordinary, so it is ordinary, which is two-fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The presence of his standing residence in a place, by some visible or external Symbole; or else,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The presence of God is a spiritual presence, in the Religious services and performances of his people, in the place of their Meetings and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Now concerning the first of these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The presence of God, by the more visible and lasting tokens of his presence, which was chiefly afforded in the time of the Levitical Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogue; so the <hi>Altar, Temple, Ark,</hi> and <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> were symbols of Gods presence among that people, by them God signifi'd his presence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded his name there by those visible tokens of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:173109:122"/> his presence; and therefore the Ark was said to be Gods face: and when the Ark was lifted up, it was said, <hi>Let God arise, and let his Enemies be scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Hence they so much rejoyced when the Ark came into the City of <hi>David,</hi> because it was the sign of Gods presence, and mourned when it was taken away captive. And God is said to <hi>deliver his glory into captivity;</hi> that is, the token of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious presence: and as long as this continued, God was looked upon as there present; and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people went to pray, and offer Sacrifice. And thus God more fixedly declared his durable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a place by these tokens, and while these continued in a place, he was looked upon to be there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods ordinary presence is considerable in the Religious services of his People, and this I call the rather the more spiritual presence of God; this is that presence of God in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which we have, we hope, this day, and which Christ did promise, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever two or three are met together in my name, there am I present in the midst of them;</hi> not in the midst of the place, but of them, when they do perform holy and institute worship. This spiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God is that that is afforded in the use of those Ordinances of Praying, Hearing, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Sacraments; his presence is there to accept of these, and to blesse them, and make them operative, and to assist in these, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both Minister and people to go through their duty by his own power. Nor can Gods presence
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:173109:123"/> be ordinarily expected, but in this his own way. Now then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You must know, that as the presence of God is the foundation of a places sanctity, and as it is severall, so you must know, Gods propriety in and relation to a place is declared by his Precept; the Precept of God is Gods propriety in a place, as well as his presence; thus it belongs to him by command to make it holy, he may do what he will, and choose out what places he will to be holy. He to whom all things belong, surely may have some places and things more proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and peculiar; so the Temple of old, and the Tabernacle, those places of Levitical and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial worship, was separated and set apart by God, by Divine Institution. Hence we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commands.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God commands, that such a House, and such a Tabernacle shall be built, and this had been unlawfull to do, had it not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He directs the manner, and the mode, and that all things should exactly be done according to the pattern in the Mount. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God doth command it should be in such a place, in the thrashing floor of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>umnah</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busite, and that place that himself had chosen.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He commands that he will be served in these places peculiarly, rather then in any other place, he would not have these places changed for others. Herein this place typifi'd Christ, one that is only able to make our services acceptable. Hence it is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:173109:123"/> said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. <hi>Three times in the year all the Males shall appear before the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 27. the <hi>Eunuch</hi> there went unto that place that God had commanded.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He doth command, that he would have these places reverenced, and no civil employments used there when the holy service was doing, and that after the service was done, at that very time the place should be only for God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And lastly, He annexed a promise unto that place, that he would accept of a duty done there rather then in any other place, even because it was done there; hence they prayed in the Temple, rather then in their private houses, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.27. and when they could not be present, by reason of Gods providence, in the Temple, if they do but look to the City and the Temple, God accepted of their duty, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.44, 48. So that God did promise, that that place that he had instituted for his worship and service, that the service per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed there should be more acceptable to him then else-where. This shews the reason and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a places holinesse, the precept of God, and the promise and presence of God. And thus I have opened to you the second thing. Now having thus explained and opened the Question to you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come to resolve the Question, according to what I think in my conscience to be the truth of God; and this I shall do two wayes.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By granting that which must not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</item>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:173109:124"/>
                     <item>2. By denying what must not be granted.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. By granting what must not be denyed; and here I grant willingly these four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in the time of the Gospel; it is not only lawful, but it is often very commendable and necessary, to design and dedicate places unto God. Now when I say, it is lawful to design them, and to dedicate them. I pray you bear me witnesse, I do not say it is lawful to consecrate them, or to sanctifie them; but I say, it is lawful to design and dedicate them. Now for this take notice, that between 1. the designing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of a place; 2: the dedication of a place; and 3. the consecrating of a place, there are these differences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the designation of a place; Then is a place designed, when it is appointed to be made use of for the most convenient for such a service, as <hi>Tuesday</hi> and <hi>Wednesday</hi> may be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Lecture-dayes, not consecrated. Now you must know, that this designation of a day may be altered, and so may a place; if such a place be designed, it is in our power to make use of it, so as to leave off the use of it when we please.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to dedication, I mean so lawfully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a place, which is of our own right to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of; so to dedicate it, as not again to be able to revoke it, or call it back from such a use and purpose. It is lawfull and commendable for a rich man, to dedicate so much ground or money, for building a House for a Free-School, or for the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:173109:124"/> poor, and to give it away from our selves, and from our own right and power; and if so be that a man hath power or propriety over a place or thing, it is lawful for a man to alienate such a thing. And yet this you must know by the way, that this Dedication that now is in the time of the Gospel, doth very much differ from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Free-will-offering unto God in the time of the Law, for they were dedicated to God in the time of the Law immediately, that is, to his immediate Worship; it was part of Gods Worship, it was a part of Religion to do that thing: whereas it is not now dedicated to the immediate worship of God, but it is dedicated immediately to such a Parish, or Minister, or Place, or company of People, that we have a good will to gratifie; and so i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> more remotely redounds to God's glory, not immediately. For God hath not declared in his Word the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in the Gospel of things done in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate way, as he had in the time of the Law, of which acceptation now we have no such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. And therefore it is observable, as one speaks concerning that Benefactor in the Gospel to the <hi>Jews, He hath loved our Nation, and builded us a Synagogue,</hi> it is not said, <hi>for God;</hi> but <hi>for us;</hi> This man out of love to us hath bestowed these things to God; which, though a giving our selves out of our own power, yet it doth differ from the Free-will-offering in the time of the Law. Ay, but now, Sirs, ye must know, that sanctification, or consecration, that is a great deal more; when
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:173109:125"/> we sanctifie a thing, or consecrate a thing, this thing that is so consecrated, it is so holy, that there must nothing at all of unholinesse, or of a civil or secular employment and concernment be done in it. Now we do not dedicate a thing, but there may be secular things in an ordinary and civil way done in them; and our services are not more acceptable for the place, nor the places lesse holy because of those civil employments. There is the first concession, that in the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there may be a designment and dedicating of places, and it is not only lawfull but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I grant, that in times of the Gospel, some places are to have Religious services performed in them, rather then in other places; I mean, places of natural conveniency and fitnesse for the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of people together, whereby they may be free from disturbance, from the violence of Enemies, and from tempestuous weather. As publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereby we have the society of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their examples to stir us up to zeal, and their joynt help in Prayer and holy performances, to go along with us, that we may joyn our forces together, and with a great force wrestle with God, and overcome him which is invincible. And therefore, my Brethren, I desire you to bear me witnesse this day, that I plead for publick Ordinances, and for the purity of God's Ordinances to be administred in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places, rather then other places, so that I do here professe, that I do avowedly and openly
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:173109:125"/> declare my judgement to be for publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in publick places, and the purity of God's Ordinances, if they may be enjoyed without humane mixture, which may hurt and pollute them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I grant, that in the time of holy service, we are not then to use secular employments at that time in those places, as eating, drinking, and talking, it being unsuitable to the work in hand and howsoever they may be lawfull at another time, yet unlawfull then, because against the Apostles command, <hi>Let all things be done in decency, and in order;</hi> and that which is unsuitable to the commands of God, the taking his Name in vain. My Brethren, I will go further with you, we are to abstain from all other Religious services, when not in season; and therefore when the Minister is in Preaching, we must not run into our places and kneel down, as some people do, and fall a Praying. And I cannot but wonder, that they that do so much cry up Uniformity and Sanctity of places, that yet they should confute their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their practice, that they should pray se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly when the whole Congregation is a praying vocally; and it may be the Congregation is sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Psalm, or the Minister Preaching, and then they go to their Prayers; I pray where is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, Decency, and Order they so much stand for?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I grant, that after the performances of holy duties, in places wherein we meet for the worship and service of God, it is our duty to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:173109:126"/> not onely from filthy and indecent action<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of a natural or moral filthinesse, unseemly, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> looked upon by men against God's Law; but from all those civil, moral, lawfull actions, at other times, that may reflect any dishonor upon the work that hath been done, or upon the work that shall be done, or that may render the place unmeet for religious services afterwards: And this is that that one calls a Negative, or a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reverence, a reverence, or not doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not because the place is more holy, but for decency and order, considering the religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties performed in that place. So that things sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to Religion call for a Negative reverence, and are not so to be used, as that the Religious services which are there performed and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, should be made disgraceful and dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; as the Bread of the Sacrament, after the Sacrament is done, is not lawfull to be cast unto unreasonable creatures, because it reflects dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor upon the religious service which we were before doing; so, dirty water is not to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Communion Cup, not that the Cup is holy, but because it is a reflection of disgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that holy service wherein that Cup is made use of; and that Cup is not to be made use of to drunkennesse. But in all this bear me witnesse that I say, all this is but a civil reverence, and so due to any place where there is any honorable Convention, as in the Parliament-house, or Presence-Chamber, or the like. Having yielded this.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:173109:126"/>2. I must come now to deny what must not be granted; and I likewise deny four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not now in the times of the Gospel in any mans power to set apart a place for Religious duties, so as that it should be unlawfull upon a due occasion to use it for civil imployments, or that it should be alwayes unlawfull to alienate to other uses, besides those uses that are Divine; the Bread and Wine sanctified by Gods own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution by the Minister, after the publick use and administration of them in the Ordinance, are not only holy, but they may be eaten in a civil use and way as our ordinary and common food: The Synagogues among the Jews were as holy as our Churches, they were for holy duties, as Prayer, Preaching, and the like, and dedicated to Gods Worship, and yet you must know there were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil imployments used in those places after the Religious Worship was done; and therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.34. saith our Saviour, <hi>some of them you shall scourge in your Synagogues.</hi> Hence we use to keep Courts and Consistories in Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, and some of them none of the best, and we use here among us in this City constantly in our Churches, (and I doubt not but it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) for an Alderman in his Ward to meet about secular businesse, as to choose Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-men, or the like. But where there hath been a dedication of a place to Gods worship, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God that can make it so holy, as that it should be sinfull to imploy it to other uses, and if the Governours of the Church upon due occasion and reason shall substitute other places more fit
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:173109:127"/> then the former for Divine Worship, then the <hi>former</hi> places may return to their former proper uses; but it is not so in things consecrated by God: If the Font, Table, or Pulpit waxe old, they may be laid aside and looked upon as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things, and may be used for other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and suppose the Surplisse be a lawfull garment in Gods worship, (which yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded none of you believe) doubtlesse it is not to be burned when it is old and past wearing, and the ashes put into a pot or some such like thing, and be buried under the Altar, but it may be used as other linnen may. And so the common Utensils, as the Cup, and the like, when they are come to be old, they may be used for other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments without fear of sin. And therefore it is an excellent speech of one; saith he, So to Consecrate moveable or immoveable goods, as that it should be a sin for the Church to use them in any secular imployments, it is an execrable and abominable Superstition: God hath not Consecrated any thing in the Gospel <hi>so,</hi> as that it is a <hi>sin</hi> to use it otherwise. It was a sin in them to make use of the Cups in the Temple in any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way, but it is not so for us: the reason is, because those things were set apart by Gods own Institution: but there can be nothing so Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by men, as that it may <hi>not be made use of</hi> in secular things without sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A second thing I deny is, That no place now in the time of the Gospel hath such an holinesse either from Institution or Use, as to sanctifie or make more acceptable or effectual the services
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:173109:127"/> therein performed: This is not in the time of the Gosple; God is present at places of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous performances, not with respect unto the Place, but the Performance by him instituted and injoyned; and therefore he doth not say, <hi>Where two or three are met together I will be in the midst of that place,</hi> but <hi>among them.</hi> God will be present in the place for the Duties sake, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them for the Places sake, but the Duties sake in the place, to blesse the Ordinance for his own Institutions sake. Prayers and other Duties in the Ceremonial Law were regarded for the places sake, but now we must abhor this piece of <hi>Judaisme:</hi> For a man to set a place apart by Consecration, that this place makes the duty any thing the more excellent or acceptable to God, this is to make the Traditions of men equal to the Institution of God. The Temple sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the duty, but not the Synagogue; and the Altar did sanctifie the gift, and the person, and service, because it was by Gods Institution, and so the Temple and Altar did adde efficacy and worth to the work; but for men to Consecrate the Church, it is to make the Appointment of men equal with the Institution of God. Our Churches and Meeting-places are not holy (if they be holy at all) without relation to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties performed, but our duties are holy without relation to the Church or the place. None but God can consecrate a place to be an effectual means of worship: The Jews worshipped God <hi>by</hi> the Temple, but we worship God <hi>in</hi> the Church; as the place doth afford a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:173109:128"/> for our meeting together; the place then hath no influence at all upon our duties, and if any of you should think so, you erre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly: It is but only a <hi>Physical</hi> Act of duty, or a natural <hi>Adjunct</hi> of duty, which is but at most helpfull to the bodies conveniency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing I deny is this, That there is no place <hi>so</hi> holy as to exclude another place from being <hi>as</hi> holy in a way of proper sanctity and holinesse, which we have been now opening. God now makes not one place properly more holy then another; there is not now prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly any religious difference of places. We have not now the Precept of God to sanctifie and separate one place from another, to prefer one place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another; we have not now the miraculous presence of God, his appearing as at the bush. God hath not given <hi>us</hi> under the <hi>Gospel</hi> those Symbols of his standing presence and residency, as by the <hi>Ark,</hi> and <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> of old he <hi>gave</hi> unto <hi>his people.</hi> And as for his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, if they make a place holy in regard of performance of duty to God there, and his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual presence in that place, then my Parlour, Chamber, or Closet are holy where I use to pray, and where God doth afford his assisting blessing and comforting presence: So that if you make the Spirituall presence of God to make a thing holy, in regard of Gods Spiritual presence going along with those services, then your <hi>Houses</hi> are holy, and the <hi>Field</hi> is holy where you <hi>walk</hi> when you <hi>meditate,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> by the <hi>River</hi> side makes it holy; Humane consecration makes no
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:173109:128"/> place truly holy. If the spiritual presence of Christ makes one place more holy then another, <hi>then</hi> the <hi>Communion-Table</hi> and <hi>Font</hi> are more holy then <hi>another</hi> place in the <hi>Temple.</hi> And so when Gods presence hath been enjoyed at the <hi>Font,</hi> that is more holy then the <hi>Communion Table;</hi> and so when the presence of God hath been enjoyed at at the <hi>Communion-Table</hi> that is more holy then the <hi>Font,</hi> and so you must bring in <hi>Judaisme.</hi> If the presence of God makes a thing holy; <hi>a new Communion-Table</hi> upon which the Sacrament was never administred, cannot be <hi>so</hi> holy as the <hi>old Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Nay, by <hi>this</hi> the <hi>mouths</hi> of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants are holy, having eaten the <hi>Bread</hi> and drank the <hi>Wine</hi> which was dedicated to an holy use, and so it will be sinfull for you to eat any other food. I conclude all with this, That the difference and holinesse of religious places in the times of the Gospel, is not given but taken away by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. 1. Tim. 2, 8. <hi>I will therefore that men pray e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry where, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> You may pray, and that with as much acceptablenesse to God in <hi>one</hi> place as in <hi>another.</hi> John 4.21. Christ saith, <hi>The time comes when you shall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father:</hi> That is, Gods worship and service shall not be <hi>confined</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> to <hi>those</hi> places, as if others were not as <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> as they. 1. Cor. 1.2. <hi>To them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be Saints, with all that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord both theirs and ours. One</hi> place for the calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ is as good as <hi>another,</hi> and therefore,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:173109:129"/>
                     <hi>Where two or three are gathered together, I will be in the midst of them</hi> And this is foretold in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2 11. and in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. So that <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>sum</hi> of all, Gods institution makes the Sabbath holy: And the Bread and the Wine set apart by Gods own Institution, <hi>after</hi> the <hi>duty,</hi> may be used in <hi>secular</hi> uses. But lastly, to name no more, no place is so sanctified by God, as that after the ceasing of that presence of God, any holinesse should belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as now when the signs of Gods presence ceased and was gone, the holinesse of that place was gone, and <hi>then</hi> it was <hi>lawfull</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>put on his shoes.</hi> And so when Gods presence ceased in the <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> the places became no other then secular and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivil. And now for <hi>us</hi> to go about (as the <hi>Papists</hi> do) a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as if that place had any more holinesse then others, is a foolish and abominable thing: How many bloody Battels have been fought, to the disgrace, as well as losse of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, for the re-gaining of the Holy-land.</p>
                  <p>Nay let me adde, <hi>those</hi> places where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God hath been formerly, when it hath been taken away, and those places have been used to Idolatry, they are the worse, and the more unholy; for this is turning the House of God into vanity.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion of all is this: whatever places are in holy duties, out of them they loose and leave all their holinesse, and therefore I say it is boldnesse for us to go about to tye Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to a place where God hath never tyed it, I cannot but wonder how it is possible for men of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:173109:129"/> reason and learning to be so blind, as to hold that the Lords day (which was set apart by God for the Sabbath, as you may see in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and afterwards by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, which doth amount to no lesse then an Institution) is not holy after the Service or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is ended, but then you may go to play at Foot-ball, and Cudgels, and Drinking, and what not, and yet that they should say, that the place of performing religious duties in, is so holy after religious performances, as that you cannot come into it without bowing the knee, and putting off the hat, and bowing to the Altar and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Table, and the like, this I cannot apprehend how it should be, and I wish any of you that are of this minde, would in private give me your reasons for it, why it should be so.</p>
                  <p>Now having explain'd the point, and given you a resolution of the question, in these particulars, give me leave to wind up all with some Uses.</p>
                  <p>First, We infer the great difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween sanctity of places under the Old Testament, and sanctity and holinesse of places under the New Testament: they under the Old Testament had the immediate presence of God, the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Symbols and visible signes of his presence, so long as these lasted: which was set apart by Gods special Commandment, and so they were holy, though they were not imployed in a way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but you cannot say so now, our places for performance of holy duties have no such holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, places now differ from places then.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by way of Inference, I note the great
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:173109:130"/> goodnesse of God to give us such a sweet and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious indulgent dispensation in the time of the Gospel under the New Testament, as that he doth not tye us to Ceremonies or places; he doth not bind us as he did the Jews, to go three times in the year to the furthermost part of the Nation to worship: No my Brethren, no Land, no ground is now unholy, as famous old Dr. <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> said, every place is now a <hi>Judea,</hi> no Coast but is a <hi>Judea,</hi> every house is a <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> every Congregation is now a <hi>Zion:</hi> see here the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God in indulging of us so far as to take any service done by us in a solemn and real man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if it had been done in those places which were formerly appointed for it to be done in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I infer hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, there are several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be reproved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We find hereby that all the holinesse of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Saints doth fall to the ground: and we see the folly of those that make Pilgrimages unto Saints and reliques as the Papists do: there was a time (say they) when such a Saints reliques were laid up in such a place, and these are more holy then other places; so that this you see falls to the ground in it self: I might tell you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lying about their reliques, as one said, that there were as many reliques as would fill an hundred Carts: but supposing so, all that would not make the place the more holy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence the Superstition of those is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, which put holinesse in places of burial, and make it more holy to be buried in one place then in another: it is more holy (say they) to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:173109:130"/> be buried in the Church then in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and more holy under the communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then any other part of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This reproves them which cannot pray any where but in the Temple, and they that use pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer in Churches: If you have houses and rooms at home, what is the reason that if <hi>Pauls</hi> or any other Church stand open you must run in thither, and drop down behind a Pillar to say your Prayers?</p>
                  <p n="4">4 This reproves them that have reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any place more then another, as if they did deserve more holinesse in one part then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as bowing to the Altar or Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or the like.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It reproves those that have reverence for scituation of these places, they must stand East and West, and why not North and South? all these things fall off like fig leaves; If what I have said be true, that there is no holinesse in places, and this I have made known to you not only as my judgement, but as my duty.</p>
                  <p>Now for Exhortation, I shall desire you to take notice of four things, and I have done, and shall leave you to God, and commit you to the word of his grace. If this be so, that there is no holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in places, then first of all be the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to serve God in your families, in those places where God hath set you, where God is as well pleased with your service as in publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; serve God upon your knees with devotion, humility and reverence. And therefore, though
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:173109:131"/> I am against Superstition, and Popish practises, and those wicked cursed traps of Innovations, that the men of the world have disturbed the Church of God with; yet I am against putting on your hats in prayer, and fitting in prayer. Those that are for holinesse of places, do not, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in every place they come build God an Altar. But let <hi>us</hi> in every closet and room build God an Altar; let no morning nor evening go without a prayer in thy family, pray often, and pray continually, let your houses be as so many Churches, as you read in <hi>Rom</hi> 16.5. <hi>Likewise greet the Church that is in their house:</hi> and in the second verse of <hi>Philemon</hi>'s Epistle, <hi>To the Church that is in thy house;</hi> there the houses of the Saints are called Churches. This will bring a blessing upon your families: And if you be not willing to have that curse denounced against you, (in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not upon thy name</hi>) then neglect not family prayers; be much in prayer, and pray with frequency and encouragement, because God binds you to no place. —</p>
                  <p>The second Exhortation is this, Labour to promote <hi>personal holinesse,</hi> as well as <hi>family devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> I am against local holinesse: As one said (that I heard once when I was a youth) Happy are those garments that can carry away any of the <hi>dust</hi> of the Temple; but they think not that many of their garments are unclean in wallowing n the mire of sin. But I say, do you labour to promote holinesse in your lives, in your hearts
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:173109:131"/> and conversations. The <hi>holy Ghost</hi> saith, <hi>Ʋnlesse you be pure in heart, you shall not see God.</hi> And therefore put away sin, for if you regard iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, God will not hear your prayers: It is not your ducking, or bowing, or cringing, never so much, or your going with your hat off through the Church, that will make God hear your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; these will but dishonour you, because you live not accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Love the holinesse of the living members, be not so much in love with the holiness of wood and timber, bricks and stones; but wheresoever you see the Image of Christ, be in love with that soul; where ever the presence of God shines, and whereever thou seest one that gives up himself to God in holy duties, do thou say, Oh! my soul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to come into the company of these men. <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour.</hi> If there be a heaven upon earth, I tell you it is in the company of godly men. I remember a famous man hath this expression, saith he, When I was in the company of the Saints and people of God, I was as a living coal; but when I was separated from them, and was among the wicked, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and drunkards, me-thoughts there was a spiritual coldnesse and frozenness went over my soul: Though the people of God are best company in heaven, yet they are very good company here on earth: And Christians should stirre up one another, and be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one another to love and good workes; and where ever you have grace, be sure to impart it. Endeavour to love the holinesse of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:173109:132"/> Saints, and be willing to impart your experiences to others, for this is your duty. Do not make a Monopoly of holiness, but carry company with you to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, to name no more, labour to preserve the holiness of God's <hi>true Institutions,</hi> those things which are of a divine consecration. What is <hi>humane</hi> consecration without <hi>divine</hi> institution? The <hi>Sabbath day</hi> is of <hi>divine</hi> institution, labour to keep it holy; this is a <hi>holy-day</hi> indeed, and <hi>this</hi> labour to keep your families from profaning of; but for other <hi>holy-dayes</hi> and <hi>holy things,</hi> they are much alike for <hi>holiness:</hi> The Lords day is a holy day indeed, and for shame do not let your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren gad abroad on this day. Truly, I do verily believe, that though here be a great company of people in the Congregation, yet they are but a handfull in comparison of what are drinking in Ale-houses, and whoring, and walking in the field, that one can hardly get home to their house for the crowd of people that are going thither. For shame let not <hi>this</hi> be told in <hi>Gath,</hi> nor published in <hi>Askelon.</hi> What! shall we stand up for the holiness of <hi>places,</hi> and yet oppose the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which God hath enjoyned and instituted? Oh! that the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> Oh! that <hi>Englands King;</hi> Oh! that <hi>Englands Parliament</hi> would do something for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, to oppose wickedness and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which will otherwise bring upon <hi>us</hi> the judgement of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and make us guilty and worthy of a thousand punishments
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:173109:132"/> And labour by prayer in your families to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that flood of prophanenesse, which you cannot by your strength prevent. And then for the Sacraments of Christ, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> these are Ordinances of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are holy, and therefore should not be given to those that are unholy; and yet those who are so much for the holinesse of places, do not care who come to the Sacrament; if they have but a nose on their face, they shall come and partake of the Ordinances, let them be what they will; this is to prefer mans institution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods institution. And then for the Lords Message and Word, that is a holy thing, and therefore love his Messengers: the Messengers of God delivering his Message with fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, you are to hear them with the same fear and reverence, and resolution to be holy, as if Christ were present. And for the Word of God, it is not enough for you to have a choice Sentence written upon the walls of your Churches, but let Gods Law be written in your hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and practised in your lives, that all the world may see you live as men dedicated to the true God, in all the duties of his wayes and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Many of these things might have been inlarged. What I have given you with the right-hand, I pray you, Christians, do not take with the left, for if you do, you will make your selves guilty of a double sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because you do not obey the truth you hear.</p>
                  <p>And 2. For putting a wrong construction upon it.</p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:173109:133"/>
                  <p>But I have better hopes of you, my Beloved Hearers, and hope that the Lord will be better unto your souls then his <hi>Ministers,</hi> then his <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>any thing</hi> else can be. God blesse you and his Ordinances, and discover his mind and will at this time to you.</p>

                     <p>MY Beloved, I do very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that upon the 24. of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Month 1651. I was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sentence of Banishment; and that very day did I preach my <hi>farwell-Sermon</hi> to my people from whom I was banished, because I would not swear against my King, having sworn to maintain his just Power, Honor and Greatness; and now behold a second tryal: Then I could not forswear my self, the God of Heaven keep me that I never may. I am apt to think I could do any thing for this loving Congregation, onely I cannot sin. But since beloved, there is a sentence gone out against us, that we that cannot <hi>subscribe,</hi> must not <hi>subsist;</hi> this is the last day that is prefix'd to us to preach; I shall now speak to you (<hi>God</hi> assisting me) if my passion wil give me leave
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173109:135"/> just as if I would speak if <hi>I</hi> were immediately to die, therefore hearken my <hi>Brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my Joy and Crown, so stand fast in the Lord my dearly beloved. Paul</hi> was now a Prisoner at <hi>Rome</hi> for the Gospel of Christ; 'twas his second imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he was not far from being offered up a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the Gospel he had preached. This Gospel the <hi>Philippians</hi> had heard him preach; and the godly <hi>Philippians</hi> having heard of his imprisonment, they so far, from <hi>Philippi</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to visit him, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his wants; a gracious temper, which I hope the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God hath given the Saints in <hi>London,</hi> and for which, if for any thing, God hath a blessing in store for them. <hi>Paul</hi> is not so much concern'd in his own bands, as in the <hi>Philippians</hi> Estate. <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> tells him that there were Heresies and false doctrines got in amongst them, but yet the <hi>Philippians</hi> stood fast; and herein <hi>Paul</hi> rejoices, writes this Epistle, bids them go on, stand fast, keep their ground, &amp; to be sure not to give an inch, but to stand fast, knowing that at a long run <hi>their labour should not be vain in the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall without any more ado enter upon the Text; in which you have two things considerable.</p>
                     <p>A most melting <hi>Compellation,</hi> and a most serious <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. A melting <hi>Compellation, My Brethren, dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A serious <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and in it 1. the <hi>matter</hi> of the duty, stand, and stand it out, and stand fast. 2. The <hi>manner,</hi> 1. <hi>So,</hi> stand so as you have stood, stand fast, 2. <hi>In the Lord,</hi> stand so, and stand in the Lord, in the Lords strength, and in the Lords Cause; to stand in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173109:135"/> your own strength, would be the ready way to fall and to stand in your own cause, for your own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would be the ready way to expose your selves to all manner of temptations: <hi>Therefore my Brethren, dearly beloved in the Lord, stand, and so stand fast in the Lord my dearly beloved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, by way of observation from the words; and if there be any wicked catchers here, let them know, that I shall speak no more than I shall draw from, and is the mind of my Text; I would not give occasion to be a greater sufferer than I am like to be. But for the words.</p>
                     <p>First, for the <hi>melting Compellation, My Brethren, my dearly beloved. Paul</hi> was an Apostle, and an high Officer in the Church of God, and he writ unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to the poorest of them, and see how he bespeaks himself unto them, <hi>my Brethren:</hi> From hence take this observation, <hi>That the highest Officers in the Church of Christ, though they are indeed by office Rulers over them, yet by relation they are no more than brethren to the meanest Saint.</hi> Here we have no such Rabbies to whom we must swear, because they say we must swear it. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>Brethren,</hi> and so writes to them, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>James</hi> a Scriptural Officer, one of the highest Apostles Christ ever made, saith, <hi>Hearken my beloved Brethren,</hi> Jam. 2.5. so <hi>Peter</hi> an Apostle of Christ, <hi>Wherefore the rather Brethren;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the beloved Disciple, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I write no new Commandment,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John 2.7. Well then,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If this be so, that the highest officer in the church of Christ, such as Christ approves of, are but <hi>brethren</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:173109:136"/> to the meanest Saint; then certainly <hi>they are but bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to their fellow-Officers:</hi> If no more relation to the toe in the body, then no more to the eies. If there be any of a light spirit would bear rule, that love to have the preheminence, I would desire them to read 2. Sciptures; the first is <hi>Luke</hi> 22.26 the second <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.26, 27. doth Christ say, <hi>Whosoever will be chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, let him be</hi> one that will domineer over your estates, over your persons, over your conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth not Christ say so? no, but <hi>whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your Minister,—let him be your servant. Even as the Son of Man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransome for many.</hi> You have this also <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. <hi>And he said unto them, the Kings of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Lordship over them, i. e.</hi> over their slaves, over their vassals; <hi>but ye shall not be so; but he that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</hi> Sure if <hi>Paul</hi> be but a <hi>brother</hi> to <hi>Philip,</hi> then he is no more to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the highest officers in the Church of Christ be but Brethren to the meanest Saint; then 'tis not for those Brethren to <hi>Lord it</hi> over their <hi>fellow-brethren,</hi> Lord it <hi>over God's Heritage:</hi> Remember, 'tis <hi>Gods He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage.</hi> I hope your consciences will bear me witness, that I have laboured as much as in me lies, to be <hi>a helper of your joy,</hi> not to <hi>Lord it over your Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.24. to press or cause you to believe this or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I believe it: if this be allow'd, then may I turn <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi> to morrow. Saith Christ to him that would have had him speak to his brother to <hi>divide the inheritance with him, Man who made me a Judge over you?</hi> Luke
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173109:136"/> 12.14. So say I, Man who made thee a Tyrant, a Lord over thy Fellow-brethren, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Neither as being Lords over Gods Heritage, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the highest Officers in the Church of Christ be but Brethren, and no more, then there should be no <hi>discord between those brethren. Behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> And truly I may comfortably speak that, and 'tis one of the greatest comforts I have in the world. I hope we have liv'd together in love, blessed be God; Let us not fall out, saith <hi>Abraham</hi> the elder, to <hi>Lot</hi> his younger cousin, for we are brethren. Beloved, the discords between Pastor and people, have made the best Musick in the ears of the Jesuits.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Are Pastors, nay the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ghest Officers that Jesus Christ hath, and doth own in his Church, but Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? oh! then let those brethren, if they will appear before the bar of their Father in Heaven with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>take care of offending the souls of their Brethren;</hi> for at the hand of every brother, God wil require the soul of his Brother. Ez. 33.6. <hi>His blood will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at the Watchmans hand.</hi> We that are called by some the <hi>dogs of the Flock,</hi> what shall we prove <hi>dumb dogs?</hi> What a comfort wil it be to my dying brethren this day, if they can but say, Lord we are clear from the blood of our Brethren? The Officers of Christ should never behave themselves so, that they should give their people occasion to say, We are brethren to Dragons. But <hi>Jer.</hi> 9 4. <hi>Take ye heed every one of his Neighbour, &amp;c.</hi> I would commend one Scripture to all my Brethren in the Ministry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. A Scripture that I would have writ in letters of gold on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173109:137"/> the lintel-posts of all Ministers doors: <hi>Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.</hi> Rather then to endanger his soul, I'le away with all these toys and gew gaws.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the terms of dearest affection, <hi>dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, longed for &amp;c.</hi> Take this observation, that, <hi>It becomes the highest Ministers, much more the lowest, to bear a most tender, vehement, ardent, strong, melting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, towards that flock or people that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge.</hi> Thus <hi>Palu</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi> in the text, my Brethren <hi>dearly beloved, &amp;c.</hi> You shal find <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles, in a thawing frame to his people, melting in love unto them: the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> were so in his heart, not only to live with them, but if God called him to die for them, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly did he love them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. That he would <hi>very gladly spend</hi> and <hi>be spent for them,</hi> carried them in his heart, and longed after them <hi>all.</hi> As for the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2 8. He as a Nurse, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and nourisheth them as children: and is so affectionately desirous of them, that he is willing <hi>to impart to them not only the Gospel, but his own Soul,</hi> because they were dear to him. Then</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Is this so, ought the Pastor so to love their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? give me leave to bespeak you in the words of <hi>Job</hi> (in respect of those hundreds of Ministers, that are to be plucked from their people:) <hi>Have pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, have pity upon me, oh ye my friends, for the hand of God hath touched me, Job</hi> 19.21. What wil nothing serve but plucking out our very eies? our very heart, (being so much the objects of the peoples love.) How sad is it for the Father to be pluckt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173109:137"/> from the child, the shepheard from the flock, the nurse from the child, this is a Lamentation, and ought to be for a Lamentation: that there must be a parting between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> who loved one another as their own Souls, this cuts them unto their very heart. And this I may say with respect to my self, I bless God, I cannot say as she of her husband, <hi>a bloody husband hast thou bin unto me, but a loving congregation</hi> have you been unto me. I know none of you have desired my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, nor to taint my name; never did <hi>I</hi> hear three in this Congregation speak of pressing any thing against me, that was contrary to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: nor can <hi>I</hi> say, that there are four in this Parish that did ever deny to pay me my <hi>legal dues,</hi> blessed be God for such a people, you have not encroached upon my conscience, as <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> have not upon yours. Pastors must love their people, do not blame them if their hearts be almost bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when they are to part with such a people.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Must the Pastor love his people? then, <hi>the people must love their Pastor.</hi> 'Tis true, it lyes in the power of man to separate the Pastor and people, but not to separate their hearts; <hi>I</hi> hope there wil never be a seperation of love, but that wil stil continue: if we do not see one another, yet we may love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; pray for one another; <hi>I</hi> hope a husband doth not cease from loving his wife because she is <hi>absent</hi> from him. But oh! for my Brethren, hundreds of them think that you are undone, though you cannot see as far as other men, you may live in love, and keep your consciences quiet.</p>
                     <p n="3">3, Must Pastors love their Peopel? then you see
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173109:138"/> from hence, <hi>what should be the grand object of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors affection,</hi> i. e. the people; not what the people have; this is great inquiry, what is the benefice worth? What's the preferment? Do they pay well, &amp;c. Whereas we should not seek so much the <hi>Fleece</hi> as the <hi>Flock,</hi> we should not take oversight of a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>love</hi> of their <hi>pay,</hi> but of their <hi>souls;</hi> nor, tis an excellent good living, as one said I have heard of, <hi>Let me have their Tythes, and let their souls go to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> but as the Apostle, <hi>I seek not yours, but you,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. And I hope there be many hundreds can say, it hath been the peoples souls they have more loved and affected, than any thing what the people had.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Once more; we must love them, and love them tenderly. Why, and yet leave them? Yes my beloved, We are so to love our people as to venture anything for them but our own damnation. I come not here to throw firebrands. I bless God I have a most tender affection for all my Brethren in the Ministry; and though I am not satisfied my self, yet I condemn no man, I believe there be many of them do as consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciously subscribe, as deny to subscribe. I protest in the fear of God <hi>I</hi> cannot subscribe; perhaps it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>I</hi> have not that light as others have; for he <hi>that doubts</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is damned:</hi> My beloved, <hi>I</hi> hope you would not have us sin against God and our Consciences. It is not my <hi>living</hi> that <hi>I</hi> desire, but my <hi>office</hi> to serve my Lord &amp; Master; but if we should (to keep communion with you) lose our communion with God, this is the ready way to have all our labour and pains lost; but as <hi>David</hi> said (and oh that I could speak it with as good hopes as <hi>David) Zadock, carry
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173109:138"/> back the Ark of God, if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and shew me both it and his habitation; but if he thus say, I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thee, behold here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.24. Brethren, I could do very much for the love I bear to you, but I dare not sin? I know they wil tell you, this is pride &amp; peevishness in us, &amp; that we have preacht against it, &amp; are tender of our reputation, and we would fain all be B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>shops; &amp; forty things more: but the Lord be witness between them &amp; us in this. Beloved, I prefer my wife &amp; children before a blast of ayr of peoples talk; I am very sensible what it is to be reduced to a morsel of bread: Let the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven &amp; earth do what he wil with me, if I could have subscribed with a good conscience, I would, I would do any thing to keep my self in the work of God, but to sin against my God, I dare not do it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>My joy and Crown,</hi> therefore my dearly beloved &amp; longed for, my <hi>joy &amp; Crown,</hi> my present joy and future crown: my joy which I value more then a crown, my principle joy. Hence observe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine▪ that, <hi>The fixed standing florishing growth of Saints in Gospel practice, and Gospel obedience, is, or ought to be matter of transcendent joy to their Pastors.</hi> It was so to the Apostle <hi>Paul; Paul</hi> heard how they stood: though there was a plague amongst them, yet they were not infected; &amp; though hee was in the gaol ready to be beheaded, yet this was his joy &amp; crown, that his people did stand, &amp; I hope my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren it wil be our joy &amp; crown to hear of your standing &amp; growth in Gospel knowledg, &amp; Gospel profession. And</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:173109:139"/>1. If this be so, as <hi>John</hi> said, I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in the truth: it should be the praiers and endeavors of all Pastors really to love the souls of their people, &amp; to pray for them: that when they cannot look after the souls of their children, yet that good nurses may be looked out for them. What a joy was it that <hi>Moses</hi> mother was made his nurse; and who can tell, it may be thought not out of any merit of ours, yet of their own clemency our governours may give us to be nurses over our own children: but if I cannot nurse my child my self, <hi>I</hi> will wish it well, and as good a nurse as I can: far be it, that those that are to succeed should not prosper: Lord it shall be the prayers of thy servant, that those that are to succeed may have a double and treble portion of thy spirit, that he may be both painfull and faithfull <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the peoples growth in grace &amp; knowledge be matter of joy to a faithful Pastour? then what do you think of those that <hi>hinder their thriving. I</hi> shall give you two Scriptures <hi>John</hi> 12.19. <hi>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves,</hi> (they durst not speak publickly, but who was it against? why, it was against Christ) <hi>perceive ye how ye prevail nothing, behold the world is gon after him.</hi> But we wil order him for that, we will be sure to lessen his Congregation; if we cannot do that, we wil shut the doors against him, see <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, for ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men:</hi> What! shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men?

                     <p>FRom this Scripture you have had these three Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: 1. <hi>That the highest Officers of the Church of Christ, though they are Rulers of them, yet they are but brethren to the meanest Saint.</hi> 2. <hi>That it becomes a true Scriptural Minister of Christ, to have a most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, ardent, strong, melting, tender affection to that Flock or People which the Providence of God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge.</hi> 3. <hi>That the fixed, standing, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and thriving of that Flock in the profession and practice of Gospel-knowledge and obedience, is matter of transcendent joy and triumph to such a godly Pastor.</hi> The 4th. which is that <hi>I</hi> would now prosecute, is this, <hi>That it is the grand and indispensible duty of all sincere Saints, in the most black and shaking seasons, to stand fast, fixed and stedfast in the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the grand thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to say to his <hi>Philippians</hi> when he was ready to have his head cut off, for so it was, he was beheaded for the testimony of Jesus: this is all he had to say when in Jayle, when in bonds, and that under Heathen <hi>Romans;</hi> you are now my Joy, you are now my Crown, oh! do but stand, and my joy, which is but two notes above <hi>Gamut,</hi> wil

Whether these are <hi>black</hi> and <hi>shaking seasons,</hi> I have nothing to say, but I am wholly now upon your duty, beloved; and for God's sake let the words of a <hi>Civilly dying Minister</hi> prevail with you. There is a kind of a Maxim among some, that in case a person dye seemingly, &amp; revive again, that the last words that was heard of that person when in a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal temper, are the only things that that person wil remember when brought to life again. It is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable beloved, what ever others may think, but in my opinion (God may work wonders) neither you nor I shall ever see the faces of, or have a word more to speak to one another til the day of Judgment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beseech you hear me, as those that would and may live with me to eternity. Mark your duty; I have spoken something concerning the <hi>Pastors</hi> duty in the morning; now for the <hi>Peoples: It is the indispensible duty of all sincere Saints, to stand fast, &amp;c.</hi> I confesse, I have a love for the whole Auditory, I have a Mess for them; but my <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s Mess is for those I once called my own people; you are my <hi>Benjamins,</hi> I wish I had a greater than a fifth for you.

If I mistake not, you may see a great turn in the World; &amp; behold at this day, the greatest turn that ever was in <hi>England;</hi> but yet you must not move, you must not stir, be true to your Resolutions, be just to your first love, go on in the Lords Work. let nothing take you off. If I have preached any false Doctrine among you, witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me at the day of judgement; but if the things I have preached be true, stand to the truths; if you do not witness against my Doctrine (mine 'tis not) but rather witness for it, remember, if you leave it, that very Doctrine will witness against you at the day of Judgement.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173109:142"/> (whom he hated, though I love you) <hi>The Baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?</hi> The doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines you have heard, have they been from Heaven or from men? Answer me, if ftom men abhor them man is a false creature, man would make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of your faith and souls; but if from Heaven why then should you not believe them? I bless the Lord, my conscience bears me witnesse, I never did so far propose a doctrine to you <hi>I</hi> would have you believe without Scripture. If the doctrines have been from God believe them, if not, abhor them, and any of those that shall dare to bring a doctrine, but dare not bring the authority of the Scripture to warrant them.

If God be God (I appeal to your consciences) worship him; do not stand disputing and doubting; do not, say shall I? shall I? if the ways you have found be the ways of God, follow them; God hath but one way to heaven, there is but one truth; if <hi>Baal</hi> be God follow <hi>Baal,</hi> do not stand wavering: do not consult with flesh and bloud; tis an infinite mercy that God will give any of us to leave Relations, Estates Congregations, any thing for Christ: ti's an infinite mercy we do not split upon a rock.

                     <p>Alas, why; would you have me marshal up all the Reasons; bid me count the starres, or number the sands on the sea shore. There is not an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in God, not a precept, promise, or threatning in the word, not an ordinance, not a providence; there is nothing in God, or in the Devil, or in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or our selves, but all would give a contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of arguments to prove the Saints should be sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, <hi>I</hi> must but hint at a few things.</p>

                     <p>First; I would argue <hi>from Jesus Christ.</hi> Believers, you <hi>love Christ,</hi> and therefore you love the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> now the honour of Christ is highly engag'd in your stedfastnesse. We never cast a deeper blot on the honour of Christ, then when we grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfast: I need not tell you so, the Jesuits, those meek Papists will tell you so, those that delight in nothing more then in the milk of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and in the bloud of Saints: they have enough if you be unsteady. 1. You dishonour Christ in his <hi>sufferings:</hi> Pray tell me Believers, why did Christ sweat bloud? why did he dye? why did he undergoe what the wrath of Devils could inflict, but for this end, to make you steadie, to give you the conquest of all spirituall Enemies, and to make you stand in that conquest triumphing. Thus <hi>I</hi> remember as <hi>Josuah,</hi> Jos. 10.24. <hi>Come, put your feet upon the necks of these kings, and they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</hi> So, Christ hath dy'd, that you might live, that you might stand; and what dishonour to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Saviour of the world, to a <hi>dying Saviour,</hi> to see a <hi>flying Christian.</hi> 'Twas never heard of, that souldiers should flye before a conquered enemy, whose legs were cut off, whose armes were broken, whose sword taken from them. 2. Tis a dishonour to the <hi>spirit of Christ:</hi> The same spirit that was with Christ in all his Agonies, this very spirit he hath given to believers that he might bring them through with some victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; therefore, when we stand not, 'tis a high disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Christ's spirit. 3. Tis a dishonour to <hi>Christ's truth:</hi> oh! let but a Saint fall, and what a dishonour doth it bring to the Truth. <hi>I</hi> have but thought of some late experiments of poor Ministers that I have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173109:144"/> heard of, carried about in triumph, look here's the man, here's the man that hath done this, that, and t'other thing; and now look here's his— I cannot excuse <hi>Noah</hi> from his <hi>drunkennesse,</hi> yet me thinks 'tis the part of a <hi>Cham</hi> to <hi>shew his father's nakednesse. I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that one hath told me, ('tis a great Truth) That <hi>Religion never suffers greater wounds, then by the hands of her professed friends;</hi> Oh! what advantage have the wieked <hi>Papists</hi> taken against us by the falls of English <hi>Professors,</hi> both in principles &amp; practice.</p>

'Tis a very great dishonour to <hi>Chrict</hi>'s <hi>rll suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</hi> Tell me man, is thy Christ able to protect the against all evil? and is he able to supply thee with all good? or is he not? if he be not, then deny him, and whatever thou hast said concening him; if he be, then stand close to him, <hi>in the mount he will he seen.</hi>

                     </list>
                     <p>Oh! that <hi>I</hi> could beat this into my heart, as well as 'tis in my head.

                     <p n="1">1, It is the <hi>safest</hi> condition: never do the Saints take hurt, but by declining, moving from their center: while at their center the Devil c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But why must I not believe it with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Look you into those three great Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Why do thy disciples transgress the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Elders?</hi> The Jewes come and tell Christ he was not a true Son of the Church of the Jewes, he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173109:150"/> was disobedient to the Church of the Jewes; why? thou hast Disciples that walk not as they ought; what do they do? they commit an unpardonable sin, <hi>They transgress the Traditons of the Elders,</hi> they break one of the greatest Commandements. What's that traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>They wash not their hands when they eat bread:</hi> This was the great sin, and they charge it on him, eat witb unwashen hands: why, why bring you in this tradition? what have you to say for it? what's that to the purpose? prove <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> that there is any thing in the Word of God that is <hi>against</hi> washing? But, prove you out of the Word of God where they are <hi>bound</hi> to wash before they eat? If you will give out your imposition, make out your institution; and let me tell you, you talk of tradition, but first you set up an Altar God never thought of; and srcondly, you pull down Gods Altar: <hi>Why do you also transgress the Commandement of God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honour thy Father and Mother; and he that curseth Father or Mother, let him dye the death: But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his Father or Mother, It is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, and honour not his Father and Mother, hee shall be free; thus have yee made the commandment of God of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by your Traditions: Ye Hypocrites,</hi> you are told of it long ago; <hi>well did Esaias prophesie of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth mee with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi> They draw near, wash their hands, wash their cups, and have filthy souls! <hi>They honour me with their lips,</hi> &amp;c. But though their <hi>principle,</hi> their <hi>heart</hi> is bad, their <hi>worship</hi> is good, is it not? No, <hi>In vain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173109:150"/> they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men.</hi> So then, my Brethren, remember, <hi>all those that teach for doctrines the precepts of men, in vain do they worship God;</hi> Here's an innocent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not against the Word of God, but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>You must wash before you eat;</hi> if you do <hi>not wash,</hi> you do <hi>transgress the traditions of the Elders;</hi> but let you starve Father and Mother, if you <hi>give</hi> but to the <hi>Church,</hi> to a <hi>Nunnery, Friery, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis all one; so that all those that will for doctrines teach the traditions of men, will render the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God of none effect; <hi>in vain do they worship me.</hi> Look therefore, wherever God doth not find a tongue to speak, do not you find an ear to hear, nor an heart to believe. Christians, if you expect <hi>Christs benediction,</hi> always call aloud for <hi>Christs Institution;</hi> so Col. 2.18, 19. one of the greatest steps you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Popery, Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility, and worshipping of Angels, intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puft up by his fleshly mind, &amp;c. Deut</hi> 12.32. <hi>What thing soever I command you, observe to do it, thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</hi> There are no Wens in the body of God's Precepts, therefore none of them to be cut off. You must not deal with God's Ordinances, as that Tyrant <hi>Procrustes</hi> did with men, if they were too long for his Bed, he would cut them shorter; if too short, he would pull their limbs out of joint to make them longer. Never think your selves in Conscience bound to lend an ear to that which God doth not find a mouth to speak.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Would you stand fast, <hi>beware of shaking do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:173109:151"/> what are those? there are a great many of such doctrines that are shaking; giive me leave to instance in three or four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As you love your souls, <hi>beware of all doctrines that tend to, and preach up licentiousnesse, loosnesse and prophanenesse.</hi> Should any tell you, you may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violate &amp; prophane the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> do not believe it; the doctrine of the Gospel is a doctrine of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; <hi>it teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world;</hi> therefore if you find any doctrine at any time that should have the least tendency to <hi>incourage</hi> you in any sin, know, 'tis a doctrine <hi>against</hi> the Gosp l.</p>

Where-ever you find <hi>any doctrine that shall tend to the lifting up of man's free-will, and debasing of Gods free-grace;</hi> know, 'tis a wicked doctrine, and against the genius of the Gospel. Perhaps the <hi>Papists</hi> will tell you, <hi>wo are alive; Paul</hi> tells you, <hi>we are dead.</hi> They say that we <hi>can do</hi> any thing; many things that we talk to the World we cannot do; they say, that we can save our selves, and close with Christ if we wil; whereas the Apostle tells you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14 <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> It may be they wil tell you, a natural man <hi>may</hi> love God with his heart, really as so, &amp; savingly; whereas the <hi>Apostle</hi> tell you, Rom 8 7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can he.</hi> Remember it, in all those <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> wherein we do agree with those whom we call <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and their brood the <hi>Arminians,</hi> so far
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173109:151"/> we agree with the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and the worst of <hi>Papists.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. As you would avoid Hell, <hi>avoid all those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that would lift up self-righteousness, and debase the righteousness of Christ:</hi> I tear I shall never be in that capacity that I would, to stand you in stead in this particular.

                  <p>My purpose is to give you some brief thoughts upon this useful and practical inference of the Apostle, from the Histories of the faithful before recorded. Therefore I will sum up the whole Text in this point.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things in this Doctrine; the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> and the <hi>Duty.</hi> I shall open both with respect to the circumstances of the Text.</p>
                  <p>First, the Encouragement, <hi>A multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> or as in the Text, <hi>Seeing we are compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with so great a cloud of witnesses:</hi> Mark, here are <hi>witnesses, a great cloud of witnesses,</hi> and these <hi>compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us round about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:173109:154"/>
                  <p>First, here are <hi>witnesses;</hi> by that term we are to understand those worthy Saints mentioned and reckoned up in the former Chapter, <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses,</hi> &amp;c. all the Saints of God that have had experience of the goodness of his providence to them, and the fulfilling of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; they are all called <hi>Witnesses;</hi> Why? because they depose a Testimony for God and speak to future generations to be constant, as they did, that they might receive the like reward. This <hi>witness</hi> was partly in their <hi>faith,</hi> and partly in the <hi>fruit</hi> of their <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They witnessed by their Faith (<hi>John</hi> 3.33.) <hi>He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.</hi> A man that hath soundly digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the promises, that expresses his faith by chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and patience under all difficulties, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, delays, and those sundry trials that he meets with, he gives it under hand and seal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it to the world that he hath to do with the true God. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They witnessed in the fruits of their faith, as they give us an instance of Gods fidelity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them that faithfully adhere to, and firmly believe in his promises; so it is said (Heb. 6.12.) <hi>Be not sloathful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise:</hi> Let <hi>faith</hi> but set <hi>patience</hi> a work, do but hold out a little while with God, and you may learn by the example of all those holy men we shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promises; they shall be made good to a tittle, and not one thing fail of all that the Lord hath spoken; as these holy men were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173109:155"/> and tossed to and fro, but it succeeded well with them at the last. Oh! then let us hearken to the deposition of these worthy wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that are recorded in the Scripture, and with such an invincible resolution as theirs was, let us hold on our course towards true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: If we do not, they that are now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as witnesses to us, will at the day of judgement be produced as witnesses against us. And pray also let us remember that we are to continue and keep a foot that Testimony to succeeding generations; for not only the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and holy men of God, were Gods wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, but all Gods peopl also are his witnesses; (<hi>Is.</hi> 43, 10.) by their faith, patience, diligence, constancy, and a chearfulness under afflictions, they are to give it under hand and seal to the world, that God is a true and faithful God. But now, if we either by our sinfull walking, or by our drooping discouragements, discredit Christ and his profession, then we are witnesses against him; we deny that Religion which we would seem to profess; and cry up (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>They profess they know God, but in works they deny him:</hi> &amp; the more dangerous, because <hi>deeds</hi> are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate then <hi>words,</hi> and so a greater evidence of what we think in our hearts. If we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there are examples;</hi> Christians of later times have more to answer for their <hi>Infidelity,</hi> than those of former ages; they that first believed the promises, believed without such a <hi>cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> or multitude of examples; many have gone before us that have btoken the Ice, &amp; that found good success from their own experience; they have <hi>commended God to us as a true and faithful God,</hi> &amp; wil not you go on?

But to come more particularly to the words:</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:173109:158"/>
                  <p>First, <hi>Lay aside every weight:</hi> By <hi>weight</hi> is meant those things that burden the soul, and make our Heavenly Progress more tedious &amp; cumbersom; and by <hi>weight</hi> is meant (I think) the <hi>delights</hi> and <hi>cares</hi> of the world, the multitude of secular busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, all our earthly contentments and affairs, so far as they are a burden to us, hinder us in our way to Heaven; these must all be put off, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.3, 4. saith Christ, <hi>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, &amp;c.</hi> The heart that is deprest, cannot be so free for God, and the Offices of our Heavenly Calling, when we give way to <hi>surfeiting, drunkenness, cares of this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The heart may be overcharged with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the World; <hi>Surfeiting</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi> must not be taken in the gross notion; you must not think of spewing, reeling, vomiting, as if to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void these were a ful compliance with Christs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; the <hi>heart</hi> may be <hi>overcharged</hi> when the <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> is not; there is a <hi>dry drunkenness,</hi> &amp; a <hi>more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned surfeiting,</hi> &amp; that is when the <hi>heart</hi> grows hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, unfit for <hi>prayer,</hi> relishes not the things of the <hi>spirit;</hi> when the <hi>delights</hi> of the flesh clog the wheel, abate that vigor and chearfulness that we should shew forth in the Worship of God, and holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the delights of the flesh withdraw us from that watchfulness &amp; diligence that is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in taking care for our souls, then the heart is overcharged: Voluptuous living is a great sin, it chokes the seeds of <hi>piety</hi> so soon as planted in the heart, so that they can bring nothing to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it brings a brawn &amp; a deadness upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

Wel then, remember Christians, you are not only <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers</hi> by the way; but <hi>Runners</hi> in a <hi>Race:</hi> If we were to speak to you only under the notion of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers in a way, this were enough to wean you from the delights of the flesh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>As stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul.</hi> The more you indulge these flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lusts, the more you hearten &amp; strengthen the great enemy of your souls, and starve the <hi>better part;</hi> but you are as <hi>Runners</hi> in a <hi>Race;</hi> by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor the duty is more bound upon you, much more should you beat down the body, &amp; keep it in subjection; the Apostle hath a notable word 1 <hi>Cnr.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, &amp;c.</hi> I beat down my body; you must either keep under pleasures, or Pleasures will keep you under; for a man is soon brought under the power dominion and tyrannie of evil customs, &amp; some brutish pleasure, by indulging the lusts of the flesh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. Be but a littl addicted to any one thing, &amp; you are brought under the power of it: The flesh waxes wanton &amp; imperious, &amp; slavery grows upon you by degrees: The more you coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker carnal affections, the more they encrease upon you; &amp; therefore you must hold the reins hard, exercise a powerful restraint. <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Penitentials</hi> gives us an account of his own

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:173109:159"/>2. The businesse and cares of this World: For, these immoderately followed, and not in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, are a sore burden, and makes the soul heavy, and allows no time and strength for God and his Service, and those happy opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of private communion with him; When we are incumbred with <hi>much service,</hi> we neglect that <hi>one thing necessary,</hi> Luke 10.42. and therefore Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans must take heed that the lean Kine do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the fat; that <hi>Sarah</hi> be not thrown out of doors instead of <hi>Hagar;</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> be not thrust to the Walls, which should be our <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>chief business,</hi> while every businesse hath its time and course. The Scriptures knowing the proneness of our hearts to temporal things, deals with us as we do with a crooked stick, we bend it so much the other way, and therefore sometimes they forbid <hi>necessary labour,</hi> John 6.28. <hi>Labour not for the meat which perisheth,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning is, <hi>not chiefly;</hi> but it bends the stick another way, <hi>Set not your affections on things on the Earth:</hi> A man must have some kind of affection to his Work here below; but we had need to be bent the other way: We may gather this from this Precept, 'Tis better to incroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World, than the World should incroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on godliness. In short, Things are a burden and clog to us, according as our delight and scope is: If the pomp &amp; encrease of the World be our end and scope, then Religion will be looked upon as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; that will be a weight, and all duties o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as a melancholy interruption, as they, (<hi>Am.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>When will the Sabbath be over?</hi> The exercise of godliness wil be a troublesome thing, and we shall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173109:160"/> go about the Work of Religion as if we went about it not: But, on the other side, if Heaven and Heavenly things be our scope, then the World is a burden, and then we shall use it in the way, but not abusing, as taking up our rest here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31, 32. Man hath a body and a soul, and he doth provide for both, but for one in <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> the soul is the chief, and therefore we must not so look after the interests and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the bodily life, as to forget the interests of the soul, or to neglect them. Many will not so grosly Idolize present things, so as to <hi>renounce</hi> things to come: I, but they so often follow the things of the world, that they neglect their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concernments. The happiness of a people lies in communion with God; and therefore that must be looked after; we must take heed that the cares of the World have not such a hand and power over us, as either to divert us from, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us for these higher and nobler pursuits, the enjoyment of God in Christ. This is the first thing the Apostle speaks to these spiritual Racers, to <hi>lay aside every weight,</hi> i. e. the delights of the flesh, and the cares of the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, The next thing to be laid aside, is sin, which doth so easily beset us. As we must guard against things without, so we must mortifie our corrupt inclinations within, or else it will soon make us weary of our heavenly Race, or faint in it. <hi>Sin</hi> you know is twofold, <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> Actual sin is not meant primarily, for that is not <hi>peccatum agens,</hi> sin that easily besets us, but <hi>peccatum transiens,</hi> the sin that passes from us;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173109:160"/> and <hi>Original sin</hi> is that which is emphatically called <hi>sin,</hi> Rom. 7, 8. Now this original corruption may be considered as meerly <hi>native,</hi> or as <hi>acquired</hi> and improved into evil customs and habits; for according to mens tempers and constitutions, as <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ey are severally disposed, so by the corruption of nature they are inclin'd to one sin more than another; as the channel is cut, so corrupt nature findes a vent and issue; in every man there is some predominant sin; and in every regenerate person some relicks of that sin, from whence is the greatest danger of his soul; thus <hi>David</hi> speaks of his <hi>iniquity, Psal.</hi> 18.23. Well then, this is <hi>that sin that doth easily beset us;</hi> Original sin improved into some tyrannie or evil custom, which doth encrease and prevail upon us more and more; Now, this is said <hi>[easily to beset us]</hi> for three reasons. Partly because it hath a great power and restraint over us, and implies the whole man; the members of the body, the faculties of the soul; so great an interest hath it acquired in our affections, it doth <hi>easily beset us,</hi> it hath great power and command over us. Partly, because it sticks so close that we cannot by our own strength lay it aside. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots, &amp;c.?</hi> A man can as soon change his skin, as lay aside his customs, that are so deeply ingraven as the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of an Ethiopian, or the spots of the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard. And partly, because it mingles it self with all our motions and actious, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It easily besets us, 'tis present with us, it impels us, and solicits us, and draws us to sin further
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173109:161"/> and further, and make us negligent in what is God's: we cannot do or speak any thing, but it will infest us in all our duties of piety, charity, justice; on every side it is interposing, vexing, thwarting the motions of the spirit, and so abates our strength, vigour, and agility, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards our course towards heaven and glory; therefore, <hi>lay aside</hi> as every <hi>weight,</hi> so every <hi>sin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Now, what is it to <hi>[lay aside?]</hi> or how can we lay aside, since sin sticks so close to us, and is ingraven in our natures?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aas.</hi> Certainly, something may be done by us; for this is every where pressed as our duty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4.22. <hi>Put off the old man,</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. we may <hi>put it off</hi> more and more, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>lay it aside.</hi> Then we are said <hi>to lay aside the sin that so easily besets us,</hi> when we prevent and break the Dominion of it, that it shal not <hi>raign over us,</hi> Rom. 6.12. <hi>Let not sin reign,</hi> &amp;c. Though it dwells in us, lives in us, and works in us, yet it should not <hi>overcome</hi> us, and bring us into bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and so it will not be imputed to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and at length when the soul shal be separated from the body, we shal be wholly free from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> I, but what must we do that we may so repress it? (the question returns) that we may break the dominion of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, this is the work of the spirit of God; but we must know, the spirit of God doth work the work of <hi>mortification</hi> two wayes: <hi>By Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> and <hi>after Regeneration;</hi> By Regena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173109:161"/> and so he doth immediately without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of ours, mortifie the deeds of sin, gives sin its death-wound: That which is left, is as a thing <hi>mortified,</hi> 'tis broken; the Scripture often speaks of this fist Work of Regeneration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11.

After Regeneration the Spirit doth more and more destroy sin, the relicks of sin, this crucified body of sin, till it dieth wholly away; this he doth <hi>in us,</hi> but not <hi>without us,</hi> Rom 8.13. <hi>Through the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the body;</hi> Not the Spirit without us, nor we vvithout the Spirit, but <hi>ye through the Spirit.</hi> What is then required of us?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seriously purpose not to sin, and promise to God to yeeld him unfeigned obedience. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially should we make this promise in the use of those sole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Rights by which the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us is confirmed. Take up a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn purpose not to grieve the Spirit, nor to break his Law, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>I have sworn, and I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgements:</hi> This purpose of heart is the root of all good actions; Therefore in the confidence of God's help, in the sence of thy own vveaknesse. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.32. We cannot lay Wagers upon our ovvn strength, yet 'tis our duty to engage our hearts to God: To sin against the light of our ovvn Conscience, and illumination of the Spirit and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173109:162"/> the chastening and instruction of our own reins, that aggravates our sin; but to sin against, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our fixed purpose of not sinning, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens sin, for then 'tis a sin of weaknesse and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, not of wilfulnesse and malice; and then we can say as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.19. when the heart is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly bent towards God, <hi>The evil which I would not, that do I.</hi> Two ways may we be said to sin against purpose, either when we are over-born besides our purpose, our purpose still remains to please God: As, when the water breaks over the bank, the bank remaining; in such a case the fault is not in the bank, but in the violence of the flood. Or 2dly, when we break off our purpose, or consent to do evil; as when we cut through the bank, the water may easily make through. There's a great deal of difference between sin dwelling in us, and sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by us; between sin remaining, and sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; and when you have a firm purpose against all sin, there is sin remaining; but 'tis not reserved, but 'tis not kept and allowed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Watch over thy self with a holy self-suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because thou hast sin within thee that doth easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beset thee; therefore <hi>consider thy wayes,</hi> Psal. 119.59. <hi>Guard thy sences,</hi> Job 31.1. but above all, <hi>keep thy heart,</hi> Prov. 4.23. Conscience must stand <hi>Porter</hi> at the door, and examine what comes in, and what goes out; vvatch over the stratagems of Satan, and seducing motions of thy ovvn heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Resist and oppose strongly against the first risings of the flesh, and the tickling and pleasing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173109:162"/> motions of sin that doth easily beset us, when it doth intice us away from God, or do any thing that is unseemly and contrary unto the duties of our heavenly calling. Oh! remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we are not debtors to the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20. Thou art tyed to the Lord by all obligations &amp; indulgence: therefore break the force of sin by a serious resistance; check it, and let thy soul rise up in indignation against it, my business is not to pleasure the flesh, but to please the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Bewail the involuntary lapses and falls with penitential tears, as <hi>Peter went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Mat. 26.57. Godly sorrow is of great use for laying aside of sin, as salt potions kill worms: When children are troubled with worms, we give them salt potions; so these bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter penitential tears are the means God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to mortifie sin; that's the reason the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Godly sorrow worketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to salvation, not to be repented of:</hi> 'Tis not onely a part of repentance, but worketh perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering durable resolutions, a walking closely with God; 'tis a means God hath blessed to this end and purpose.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Recover from thy falls, renew thy combate; as Israel, when they were overcome in battle, they would try it again and again, <hi>Jud.</hi> 20.28. Take heed of ceasing for the present; for though thy enemy seems to prevail, though the flesh seems to prevail against the spirit in the battle; yet thou shalt have the best of it in the war; by the power of grace thou shalt have the victory.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:173109:163"/>
                  <p>Thus I have gone over the <hi>privative</hi> part of our duty, <hi>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset us:</hi> I should have come to the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, Let us run with patience the race that is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us;</hi> there is the <hi>duty, Let us run the Race that is set before us;</hi> and there is the manner of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Let us run <hi>with patience.</hi> I should have shovvn you, That a <hi>Christian life is like a Race</hi> from Earth to Heaven, in a vvay of holinesse, and exercise of Grace. This Race it continues as long as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the World, from our Nativity, to our death; after death the strife is ended. Now in this <hi>race</hi> we must <hi>run,</hi> and <hi>so run that we may obtain the Crown,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24. Running is a motion, and a speedy motion; there is no lying, sitting, or standing, but still there must be running: We must make a further <hi>progress</hi> in the vvay to Heaven, <hi>forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</hi> Phil. 3.13.</p>
                  <p>The Runner was not to enquire how much of the vvay already vvas past, but to strain himself to overcome what vvas yet behind: And so should vve consider what sins are yet to be mortified, what duties yet untouched, almost untouched; what hard Conflicts are yet to be undergone, and still to hold on our way without twining aside, or halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing because of difficulties, discouragements, stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks. And there are <hi>fellows</hi> and <hi>co-partners</hi> vvith us that run this Race, vvith vvhom we may strive in a holy emulation, vvho should go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardest, who should be most forward in the course of pleasing God: Oh Christians! there are many contentions amongst us, but when shall we have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173109:163"/> this holy contention? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. In a Race there is the <hi>Agonotheta,</hi> the Judge of the sports; so here God observes all; no matter vvhat the standers by say, the Judge of the sports must decide vvho must have the Crovvn, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3, 4. And then, at the end of the race there is the Crown, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8 <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kepe the Faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteousness, &amp;c.</hi> In a Race there are <hi>spectators,</hi> so there are here, God, Angels and Men, 1 Cor. 4.9. <hi>We are a spectacle to the world, to Angels and to men, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus for the similitude of our Race in our way to Heaven. Now wherein it differs.</p>
                  <p>This is a Race, not undertaken out of <hi>wantonness,</hi> but out of <hi>necessity:</hi> God hath called us to this course; and if we run not in this Race, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. And in other Races, but <hi>one</hi> had the Crown; here all are crowned, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. though they be not so eminent as the Apostle; here all are crown d that run in the manner God hath requir'd; <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that day, and not to me onely, but to them that love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:173109:164"/>2 Because we meet with many impediments, troubles and temptations by the way; there are spiritual adversaries with whom we most fight; for, we go on, we not onely run, but fight; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>run with patience, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are here met this Evening to perform the last Office of Love for an eminent and ancient servant of Jesus Christ, and excellent Minister of the Gospel, <hi>Mr. Simeon Ash,</hi> one who hath formerly performed this office for many other Ministers, and now vve are met to perform this office for him; and it is not long before others will meet to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the same office for us, so frail, so brittle, and so uncertain is the life of man.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:173109:166"/>
                  <p>Now the Text that I have chosen, is suitable for this occasion; for this Reverend Minister was first a righteous man; he was righteous in an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sence, he was one that was justified and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Secondly, He was a merciful man both in an active and passive sence; he was one that shewed mercy to the distressed Members of Jesus Christ, and he was one to whom God shewed mercy; this righteous and merciful man is now perished as to his outward condition, not as to his everlasting condition; but as to his outward bodily condition he is perished, and he is taken away: The word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is very emphatical: <hi>Merciful men, Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur,</hi> are gathered; it is the same Word that is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed concerning <hi>Josiah,</hi> 2 King. 22.10. <hi>Thou shalt be gathered to thy Fathers, and go to thy grave in peace, and shalt not see the evil that I will bring upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This godly and righteous man is now gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ripe Corn in the Barn of Heaven; he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the evil that is to come, from the beholding that evil that is coming upon the sinful World; he is taken away in mercy, that he may not be troubled with the troubles that are coming upon many; he is taken away from the evil to come.</p>
                  <p>And thus you see how suitable the Text is to the occasion; there is onely one particular that I desire may prove unsuitable; for the <hi>righteous and merciful man</hi> in the Text, <hi>perisheth, and no man considers, nor lays it to heart:</hi> These words are <hi>verba Commentantis &amp; objurgantis;</hi> the words of the Prophet bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spiritual security of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> chiding and reproving them for their spirirual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173109:166"/> Now I desire that this part may not prove suitable, but that all of you may lay to heart the death of this ancient, merciful, righteous man.</p>
                  <p>The observations from the words are these six.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That the righteous man must perish as well as the unrighteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That the perishing of a righteous man is nothing but his gathering to God, Christ, and the blessed company of Saints and Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That a righteous man as long as he liveth, is the preservative of a Nation, and the supporter of a Kingdom, the Chariots and horsmen of a Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The death of a righteous man is a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-piece from Heaven, a Beacon set on fire to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of evil approaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>That God doth on purpose take away righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, that they may not see the evil that is coming on a Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>That it is a great and common sin not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and lay to heart the death of a righteous man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, It is a common sin, and therefore it is set down in the greatest latitude; <hi>the righteous perisheth, and no man layes it to heart;</hi> that is, very few: <hi>And merciful men are taken away, no man considering;</hi> that is, very few.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, It is a great sin; and therefore the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the former Chapter calls to all the Beasts of the Field to devour, that is, all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church to destroy the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> because they drank strong drink, filling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with merriment, and promised themselves happy days, but did not consider that <hi>the righteous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173109:167"/> were taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall begin with the first, <hi>That the righteous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish as well as the unrighteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How is it that the righteous perish? not in their soul, they cannot perish so; nay, the truth is, they cannot perish properly in their bodies; for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints never totally and finally perish; for the very dust of the Saints in the grave, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in God's sight, and they are asleep in Jesus; and by the povver of Jesus Christ they shall be raised again glorious bodies: Nothing perisheth of a righteous man by death totally and finally, but sin; and therefore the meaning of the Word is as <hi>Musculus</hi> and <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> observe, <hi>perit,</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, that is, not according to the truth of the thing, but according to the opinion of the World; and the proper language of this expression is this, <hi>The righteous perish,</hi> that is, the righteous must dye and go down to the house of rottennesse as well as others, and that upon a four-fold account.</p>
                  <p>First, Because the righteous are included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute of death as well as the unrighteous; <hi>statutum est,</hi> Heb. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye;</hi> the righteous as well as the unrighteous: Indeed it is true, Jesus Christ hath taken avvay the hurt of death, but not death it self; Jesus Christ hath disarmed death, made death like the Viper that fastened upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand, but did not hurt him; he hath made it like the brazen Serpent that hath no sting, but a healing power in it; Christ hath sanctified death, conquered and sweetned Death; at present we are all under the statute of Death, but at last this Enemy shall be destroyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. latter end.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:173109:167"/>2ly. The righteous consist of perishing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as wel as the unrighteous; the righteous are earthly vessels, made of dust; their foundation is in the dust; their lives are a vapor as wel as the lives of the unrighteous.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The righteous must die as wel as others, becaus they have a body of sin that they carry about with them; for there is no man so wise, that lives and sins not, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.20. Wherefore there is that which deservs death in a righteous man.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, and especially, The righteous must perish upon a peculiar account; <hi>For if we had hope only in this life</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we are of all men most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable;</hi> and therefore they must perish to keep them from perishing; they must say as <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Periissem nisi periissem;</hi> they must die, that they may rest from their labour; for here is not our rest, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.10. there remaineth a rest for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; there is no rest in this world; the word <hi>[quies]</hi> wants the plural number.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. The righteous must die, that they may have their reward, their Crown of glory that God hath laid up for them; they must first fight the good fight, and finish their course, and then they shal receive a Crown of glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. They must die, that they may be free from sin; for they shal never put off the body of sin, till they put off the body of flesh.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. They must die, that mortality may be swallowed up of life, that corruption may put on incorruption.</p>
                  <p n="5">5ly. They must die that they may be perfect in Grace.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:173109:168"/>
                  <p>Lastly, They must dye, that they may see God face to face, and be for ever with the Lord, which they cannot do till they dye; therefore blessed be God that the righteous must perish. If a man should bring news to a righteous man, That he should alwayes live on earth, always be young, rich and healthful, it would be unwelcome News; for while we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord, and subject to sin; and therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> asked Christ what should be done with <hi>John,</hi> Christ tells him, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what's that to thee?</hi> from henceforth there went a report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that <hi>John</hi> should not dye, <hi>John</hi> 21.32. Now the Apostle himself was much displeased with this report, and look't upon it as a great affliction that he should not dye, and therefore he himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes it; <hi>But yet Jesus</hi> (said he) <hi>said not that he should not dye;</hi> as if he had said, God forbid that I should not dye.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to the Application of this point, give me leave to speak something to the second point, and so I shall apply them both together.</p>
                  <p>The second Doctrine is this, <hi>That the perishing of a righteous man, is nothing but a gathering of him to God, Christ, and the blessed Society of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is contained in the second expression, <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful men are taken away;</hi> the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <hi>Colliguntur,</hi> they are gathered; it is exegetical of the former; they did not perish, but they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173109:168"/> to God and Christ; there is a great deal of excellency, and a Magazine of sweetnesse in this expression, <hi>They are gathered:</hi> It implies two things,</p>
                  <p>First, That the righteous are in a scattered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition while they are in this World, and that three wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, They are scattered among the wicked and ungodly of the World, as sheep among Wolves; as Lambs among Lions, rent and torn in pieces, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to wander up and down in Sheep-Skins, and Goat-Skins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, The righteous are scattered in the World one from another, and that two wayes: 1. They are scattered by their different habitations; for the godly are forced to separate one from another, as <hi>Lot</hi> from <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. They are scattered one from another by the cruel persecution of wicked men; and therefore you read <hi>Acts</hi> 8. that at that time when there was a persecution against the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that they were all scattered abroad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, The godly are scattered in this life from the glorious presence of God in Heaven; indeed they are never scattered from the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, but sometimes they are scattered from the comforting presence of God; and as long as we live in this World, we shall be scattered from the glorious presence of God; for while we are in the body, we are absent ftom the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This implies a bringing of God's people out of this scattered condition; it is a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the righteous out of this World, into
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173109:169"/> another, from a sinful persecuted world, into a sinless glorious world, from diversity of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings on earth, to dwel altogether in one heaven; it is a gathering out of the reach of men and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels: a gathering them not only to the gracious, but to the glorious presence of God and Christ, and to the souls of just men made perfect, and to the general assembly of the first born, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where they shall live together, never to be scattered again. To understand this the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let me offer three things to you, shewing you that the godly are gathered to God three ways: In this life, at death, and at the day of judgment.</p>
                  <p>First, the righteous are gathered to God in this life, and that is at their first conversion; for by nature we are all aliens and strangers to God, scattered from any union or communion with God; not only scattered from the glorious but from the gracious presence of God. God made man at first to enjoy communion with himself; but <hi>Adam</hi> lost this by his sin, and now we are all <hi>Cains</hi> and Vagabonds, scattered from the love of God, and from union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; but when God converts any of the Elect, he gathers them home to himself; for conversion is nothing but God's gathering them to himself in the second <hi>Adam</hi> that were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from him in the first <hi>Adam;</hi> the first <hi>Adam</hi> was a root of scattering, a root of separation from God; but the second <hi>Adam</hi> was a root of union and conjunction. Christ is the head, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173109:169"/> all the elect are all gathered together in him; 1 <hi>Eph.</hi> 10. that he might gather together in one all things in Christ; so that conversion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gathering of the elect of God to Christ by faith, and a gathering to one another by love and charity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods people are gathered at death; here they are gathered to Christ by grace, but at death they are gathered to Christ in glory; here they are gathered to God by hope, but at death by fruition; here Christ is gathered to us, he comes down &amp; dwells with us; but at death we shall be gathered to him, we shall go up, and be joyned with him. There's a great deal of difference between <hi>esse cum Christo,</hi> and <hi>esse in Christo; esse cum Christo,</hi> to be one with Christ is a Christians great security; but <hi>esse in Christo,</hi> to be one in Christ, it is a Christians great felicity: In this life we are gathered to God by faith, but at death by vision.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, we shall be gathered to God at the day of Judgment; it is called the day of the gathering of the Saints together; A day when all the Saints that are, have been, or shall be, shall all be gathered together. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.1. I beseech you brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him at the great day; At the day of judgement we shall all be gathered together, and shall be all taken up to heaven; I mean all the righteous, and be ever with the Lord; and so much for the opening of the doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be objected; Are not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173109:170"/> gathered by death as well as the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</p>
                  <p>I answer, It is true, the unrighteous are scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life, and gathered by death as well as the righteous, but with a great deal of difference.</p>
                  <p>First, the wicked are scattered in this life, but they are scattered from God; but the godly are scattered for God, and for a good Conscience many times, as they at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were scattered: The godly are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the glorious presence of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but the wicked are scattered from the gracious presence of God on earth. Again, the scattering of the wicked is a curse to them, and it is threatned as a curse, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26 32. <hi>I will scatter you among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and draw out my sword after you:</hi> And wherever the wicked come, in what part soever of the World the wicked are scattered, they bring the curse of God with them; and they bring the Judgements of God on Towns or Cities where they are, as Plague, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and Sword, and all miseries. But the godly when they are scattered, they are scattered as a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; into what Countrey or Town soever they come, they come as a blessing, they come like a ship laden with Corn, to a Town ready to perish with Famine; they come as a blessing four ways.</p>
                  <p>First, By their prayers, to pray down a blessing on the place where they come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They come as a blessing by their holy life and conversation; that is a Loadstone to draw others to holiness.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They come as a blessing by their holy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173109:170"/> advice and counsel that they give to the place where they come.</p>
                  <p>Nay fourthly, their very presence is a blessing; as long at <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>Sodom, Sodom</hi> could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed; so long as <hi>Paul</hi> was in the Ship, the three hundred could not be drown'd. So that the godly come as a bles ing where-ever th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y are scattered, but the wicked are as chaff scattered by the Wind, and they are scattered as the dust of the earth. You know when the dust is scattered, it gets into mens eyes, and blinds them, and falls upon their cloaths and sullies and defiles them; so the wicked where-ever they are scattered, they defile the place where they are scattered. The godly are as Planets, that wander and move from one part of Heaven to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, carrying light to the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the vvicked are scattered while they live, so vvhen they dye, they are gathered; it is tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: But hovv? not to God and Christ, and his Angels; but they are gathered to the Devil and his Angels, and to damned spirits; not as bundles of Wheat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Barn of Heaven, but as bundles of Tares to be burned for ever in everlasting fire.</p>
                  <p>Now, if the righteous perish as vvell as others, and if their perishing be nothing but a gathering to God and Christ: Then</p>
                  <p>First, learn hence the preciousness of every righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man; the great God wil not gather things of no value; great men do not use to gather chaff and straw; and therefore when God saith of <hi>Josiah I will gather thee to thy Fathers,</hi> it was a sign he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173109:171"/> was a precious pearl worth the gathering, and of a high value and account in the sight of God; and so is every true child of God; right dear and precious are they in the sight of God, both living and dying; they are bought wirh a great price; not with gold and silver, and other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things; but they are bought with the precious blood of the Son of God: They are as precious to God as the apple of his eye; so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious that he hath given Christ for them and to them; so precious that he called them his Jewels, his peculiar treasure, his <hi>Jedidiahs,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will not suffer them to perish, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to himself before the evil day come, as the husbandman gathers in the corn before the beasts go out into the field.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Learn here what reason we have to be comforted in the death of a righteous man or woman, because their death is not a perishing, but a gathering to God and Christ, and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Saints and Angels. The death of a righteous man is no more then if a Merchant that hath abundance of Jewels in a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he should send for them home. Why death to a righteous man is nothing but Gods sending for his Jewels home. Such a phrase there is in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. In the day that I make up my Jewels they shall be mine. In this life they are imperfect Jewels; they are like gold in the oar mingled with a great deal of drosse; and death is nothing but a perfecting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hese Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels; death is nothing more; and God doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by death, but as a gold-finder gather up
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173109:171"/> all his ends of gold and silver: It is nothing but just as if a Father should send for his Son home that had been a long while absent from him to his own house; it is a carrying us to our Father's house: And therefore let us be comforted when our righteous friends die; though their death be matter of sorrow to us, in regard of the loss that we sustain by their death; and because their death is a warning-piece of evil to come; yet in regard of them we have no cause to mourn. I speak this to those that are related to the righteous when they die; Did you ever see a Husbandman that mourned for the carrying of his corn into the Barn? or a Jeweller mourn for making up of his Jewels? Let us mourn rather that we are left scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among the wicked of the Earth, &amp; from the glorious presence of God and Christ; and let us mourn for those that are scattered from Christ, and from grace; and for those that whilest they live, are scattered, and when they die, are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Divel and his Angels: Let us not mourn for those that die in Christ, but let us mourn for those that live out of Christ; let us not mourn over the body that the soul hath left, but let us mourn over the soul that God hath left.</p>
                  <p>The third Use is of Consolation to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in reference to evil times that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, or to the evil of times. Whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls a Child of God in this life, though he be scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by wicked men, from <hi>England</hi> into Foreign Countreys, though he wander up and down in Desarts and Wildernesses, though he be scattered from house to prison, yet there will be a gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173109:172"/> time shortly; there will a time come when all the Saints shall be gathered to Christ, and to one another, never to part any more. The death of God's people is not a perishing, but a gathering; comfort your selves therefore with these vvords, against the fear of death; look upon death as a gathering, as a gathering to Christ: You are here as <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the Dungeon; yet there will come a gathering; and if you dye in a good Cause, you shall not perish, but be gathered to Christ, to his Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, <hi>If I were sure when I dye, that I should be gathered to Christ, to live for ever with him, this would be matter of great consolation to me; but you told me, the wicked are gathered by death as well as the godly; how shall I know whether (when I come to dye) I shall be gathered to the Devil and his Angels, or to Christ and his Angels? How shall I know whether I shall be gathered at death as a bundle of tares to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hell, or as a bundle of Wheat to be carried up into the Barn of Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, you may know it by four things.</p>
                  <p>First, If you are righteous, then you shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to Christ at death; <hi>for the righteous shall go into everlasting life:</hi> Heaven is entailed upon righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men; by righteousness I mean the imputed righteousness, and the imparted righteousnesse of Jesus Christ: I wave the explication of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause time will not give leave. <hi>Know you not</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that no unrighteous man shall inherit the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173109:172"/> Kingdom of God?</hi> Damnation is entailed upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous men:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you are merciful; the merciful man shall be gathered to Christ: If you are one that is full of bowels of compassion to the distressed Members of Jesus Christ, for Christ hath said it, <hi>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</hi> Now if you are hard-hearted, covetous, worldly-minded, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Text, <hi>He shall have judgement without mercy, that shews no mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He that is gathered to the second <hi>Adam</hi> by faith in this World, shal certainly be gathered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ by vision in the other World; Christ Jesus will save all his Members; and you must know, that Faith is a transplanting Grace; it is not only a heart-purifying, but a World-overcoming Grace, it takes a man out of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and puts him into the new <hi>Adam;</hi> it takes a man out of the root of scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and puts him into the root of union &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: Wherefore you that are now joined to Christ by faith here, shall be joined to Christ in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter: But now you that are Vagabonds, <hi>Cains</hi> and Aliens from the life of God, and from the life of Grace: You that are wooden members, wooden legs in Christ's body, that have no real conjunction with Christ, you shall not be gathered to him in glory.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, If you are gathered here to the Saints by love, then you shall be gathered to the Saints in Heaven, and to the everlasting enjoyment of God with them to all Eternity. Consider this; Every man shall be gathered (when he dies) to those whom he delights, and chooseth to keep company
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173109:173"/> with while he lives in the world: if you are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the wicked in love and affection here, you shal be gathered to them at death in Hell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; for it's pity companions should be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Wheat must to Wheat, and Tares to Tares; for Wheat and Tares shal not be bound together at the last day.</p>
                  <p>The last Use is of Exhortation: If the righteous must perish, and if their death be nothing but a gathering, then take this threefold Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>First, Let us labour to make the best use we can of our godly friends and Ministers before they are gathered; let us do as <hi>Elisha</hi> did; he was told that his Master <hi>Elijah</hi> was to be taken up to Heaven, and therefore he would never leav him till he had got the spirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> doubled upon him: If <hi>Elisha</hi> had not thought that <hi>Elijah</hi> would have been taken up that day, he would never have followed him so punctually and inseparably as he did. O beloved, did you believe that text, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1 5. of which wee have often had experience, <hi>Your Fathers where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever?</hi> Indeed if they did live for ever, we might get good from them when we please, because we are sure never to lose them; but they live not for ever, but must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and be taken up to Heaven: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whilst we have them, let us make what use we can of them, before they be taken away from us. It is a great fault among the people of God, that they make no more use of their godly Friends and Ministers. I have known many that have godly Relations that have died, that it hath
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173109:173"/> been the greatest burthen on their Consciences, that they got no more good by those godly Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions while they lived. Many of us deal with our Ministers as we do with a strange fight that is to be seen near our doors; we are not much solicitous when we see it; but a stranger that comes from a far Country, is curious, and very careful present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to see it. So do we in this City especially; I have had experience of it by being here many years strangers that come out of the Country, many times get that good by a Minister, that his own people do not, because they think their Minister is continually with them: But a stranger knows he is there but for a day, and he hears so, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Christ home with him, &amp; a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation also. Beloved, this is a great fault; I beseech you remember, the righteous must be gathered; let us therefore do with them as we do with Books that are borrowed; if a man borrows a Book, he knows he must keep it but for a day or two, and therefore he wil be sure to read it over; whereas if the Book be a man's own, he layes it aside, becaus he knows he can read it at any time. Remember, your Ministers are but lent you, they are not your own, and you know not but God may take your <hi>Elijahs</hi> from you this night: Therefore make what use you can of them, while you have them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Must the righteous be taken away? Then let the righteous make conscience of doing what good they can before they are taken away. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if it were possible for the godly to grieve in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173109:174"/> Heaven, this would be their greatest sorrow, that they have done God no more service here upon Earth. Be wise for God, O ye righteous; do as old men do that have rich places and offices; they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to buy the reversion of their places for their Children; so must you to whom God hath given great gifts and graces, labour to propagate your gifts and graces, that there may be no loss by your death. Observe the care of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the aged in his exhortations to <hi>Timothy;</hi> 2 Tim. 4.5, 6. <hi>Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an Evangelist, make full proof of thy Ministry;</hi> why so? <hi>for I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is at hand;</hi> and therefore work thou, see that thou endure affliction, preach the Gospel as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Minister of the Gospel, that there may be no loss by my departure; so in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The things that thou hast heard of me among many Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the same commit thou to faithful men, that shall be able to teach others also.</hi> Hath God committed any thing to you? a treasure of Learning or Grace; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to young Ministers, that they may commit it to others, that so there may be a succession of gifts and graces. Do as Physicians do, that labour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their skill to their children and to others; so should we, that so there may be a succession of godly ones, that godliness may be entailed upon us and our Relations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, Let us all labour to be such, that when we dye, when we come to be gathered, we may be gathered to Christ and his Angels, and not to the Devil and his Angels. And for that purpose, let us labour to be merciful and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173109:174"/> and let us be gathered to Christ by faith, and to one another by love and dear affection, and then we shall be gathered at the great day to Christ, and the blessed company of Saints and Angels.</p>
                  <p>There are four observations yet behind, but I must wave them at this time.</p>
                  <p>I have now another Sermon to preach, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without injury to you that are alive, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrong to the memory of my dearly beloved Brother, but speak something of him at whose Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vve are met this evening, not so much for his commendation, he needs it not, but for our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is pitty, great pitty something should not be said, that this Reverend Minister, though dead, may yet preach this night; and I have so much to say of him, that I know not where to begin; and when I I have begun, I hardly know how to make an end: <hi>I</hi> must confess, the little time allotted me for the providing for this solemn Work, and the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary avocations in this little time, have hindered me from informing my self about his breeding and manner of education at <hi>Emanuel Colledge</hi> under Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and his excellent carriage and converse with Mr. <hi>Hildersam,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langley,</hi> and other Ministers famous in their generations; and the many pressures and hardships that he suffered in those parts and times, for the keeping of his Conscience pure from that which he counted sinne; and therefore I must draw a vail over that part of his life, and confine my discourse onely to the time since his coming to live with us in <hi>London,</hi> about is about the space of twenty two, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173109:175"/> three and twenty years; all which time, I have had the happiness to be intimately acquainted with him, insomuch as that I can freely and clearly profess, and that with a sad heart, that I, and many others, have lost a real, wise, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friend, brother, and fellow-labourer in the Lord; the Church hath lost an eminent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and choice pillar: and this City hath lost an ancient, faithful, and painful minister; who by his prayers and holy life, did seek to keep off the Judgments of God from falling upon us; and the less sensible the City is of this loss, the greater is the loss. I fear we may too truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the words in the Text, <hi>The righteous perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and no man layes it to heart; and mercifull men are taken away, none considering that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</hi> I have read of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and by chance met with the same in the life of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that when they came to any City or Town, and heard of the death of any godly man, though never so poor, they would both of them mourn exceedingly, because of the great loss that place had by the death of that godly man, and because it was a warning-piece from God of evil approaching. But we have had many godly men, and godly ministers, taken away of late, and yet I fear me, but few lay it to heart; and therefore as I said, the loss is the greater to this City, because it is so little sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it. It is a great loss also to his relations; his wife hath lost a dear and loving husband, his sister a dear brother, his parish and congregation a faithful pastour.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:173109:175"/>
                  <p>The ministerial excellencies of many ministers were collected and concentred in one <hi>Simeon Ash;</hi> he was a <hi>Bezaleel</hi> in Gods tabernacle, a master builder, an old disciple, a Polycarpe, a Christian of long standing in the school of Christ, a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a shining light, one whom many mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and other good Christians called father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that it was a common proverb in this City, father <hi>Ash;</hi> and I believe, many experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally lament over him, as the King did over the Prophet <hi>Elisha; My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!</hi> For he lived desired, and died lamented; not only in the City, but I believe in very many places in the Country where he was known. But more particularly, there were twelve excellencies that I observed in this Reverend Minister, and my dear brother, that were as twelve jewels or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearls in that crown with which God had crowned him: I shall name them for your imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and benefit; he needs them not, for he is above our Eulogy.</p>
                  <p>The first and chief Jewel that did beautifie and adorn this our brother, was his sincerity and uprightness of heart; which indeed is not a single grace, but the soul of all grace, and the interlineary that must run through all grace; for what is faith if it be not unfained? what will love to God profit you if it be not without dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation? what is repentance worth if it be not in truth? as the body without the soul is a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carkasse, so is all grace without sincerity; this is the soul of all grace, this is the girdle of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:173109:176"/> truth. Sincerity is that which girts all our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual armour together, and makes them useful; what advantage is it to have the breast-plate of righteousness, the shield of faith, the helmet of hope, if they be but painted things? it is the girdle of sincerity that makes all the other parts of our armour useful. Now this excellent grace of sincerity was eminent in this our dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he was a true <hi>Nathanael,</hi> in whom there was no guile; I mean, no allowed hypocrisie; and this was that which carried him through the pangs of death with a great deal of comfort; for hee was able to say with <hi>Hezekiah, Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart.</hi> He could say with <hi>Paul, This is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, the testimony of my conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, I hnve had my conversation in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, another Jewel was his humility; this is a grace that he was cloathed withall, and it is a rare grace; for God dwells with the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble. This reverend minister was low in his own eyes, and therefore very high in God's eyes; hee had a mean esteem of himself, and therefore he was in high esteem with God. Hee was as <hi>Jacob</hi> said of himself, less then the least of God's mercies, and therefore he was made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the best of God's mercies. He was like an ear of corn full of fruit, bowing down in thankfulness to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another Jewel was the fruitfulness of his discourse; for it may be said of him, as it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173109:176"/> was of Christ, he went about doing good; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went, he scattered his goodness; this all that knew him, know to be true. He was full of good discourse where-ever he came. When I was with him in his sickness, he took occasion to complain much, and not without just cause (God grant his complaint may make impression upon our hearts) he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was a great fault among Ministers, that when they met together, they discoursed no more of Christ, of Heaven, and of the concernments of the other World; and professed, that if God should restore him, he would be more careful in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and more fruitful than ever yet he had been.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another Jewel that beautified this righteous man, was his mercifulness: He was a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful man, which he manifested not onely in his charity to the members of Jesus Christ, but in his frequent visiting of sick persons, and persons that needed his spiritual Physick. I know not any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in the City more careful in visiting the sick, than he was.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Another Jewel was his prudence and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wisdom; he was not onely a pious and godly, but a wise and prudent Minister, that had zeal for God, but knew how to mingle his zeal with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; discretion indeed without zeal, is nothing but carnal policy; but zeal without discretion, is nothing but frantick fury; discretion without zeal wil quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat out the heart of Religion, and eat Religion out of the heart. Zeal without discretion is not a Coal
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173109:177"/> from the Altar, but a coal kindled by the Wild-fire of passion, that is able to set a Nation on fire; but this Reverend Minister had zeal sweetly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with discretion.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Another Jewel was his patience; God was pleased to exercise him with long &amp; great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions by reason of the Gout, that did often, especially of late years affix him to his bed, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him with great pain; but God was pleased to put his everlasting Arms underneath him, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting him under all his pains, &amp; giving him a great measure of patience, insomuch that in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he did possess his soul, and patience had its perfect Work in him.</p>
                  <p>The seventh Jewel was his high valuation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; a written copy for us to follow; &amp; for you his people also. Being with him in his last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he exhorted me &amp; other Ministers with him to preach much of Jesus Christ, and to speak to him of Jesus Christ; and he said, <hi>When I consider my best duties, I sink, I dye, I despair; but when I think of Christ I have enough, he is all, and in all.</hi> I think these were his very words. <hi>I desire</hi> (said he) <hi>to know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified: I account all things dung and dross, that I may be found in Christ:</hi> To this effect he spake in the morning before the evening in which he dyed, speaking much of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Another Jewel was his diligence in preaching the Gospel in season and out of season; in the time of his health he was a painful, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preacher; one that did not preach to tickle the ear, to wound the heart; not to please, but to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:173109:177"/> profit; not seeking the applause of the people, but the salvation of their souls: This all know to be true.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Another Jewel that did beautifie and adorn this Reverend Minister, was his excellent gift in Prayer; and herein he was very eminent, and did exceed many, nay I may say most of his Brethren: As <hi>Apollos</hi> was mighty in the Scriptures, so was he (as you all know) mighty in prayer; he was a <hi>Jacob,</hi> very skilful in wrestling with God, like <hi>Moses</hi> he often stood in the gap, and at most Fasts in the time of his health, he was the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that was chosen to conclude with prayer; and this heightens the loss that we sustain by the death of this godly Minister, because we have lost the benefit of his prayers, which is an invaluable loss; for though I doubt not but he prays in Heaven for the Church in general, yet I believe he prays not for any in particular, as not knowing what our condition is, <hi>For Abraham knows us not,</hi> for the Saints in heaven know not what is done upon earth. The loss therefore is the greater, because we have lost not only a preaching, but a praying-Minister: And give me leave to add, that this excellency in this Minister, is sufficient to prove, 1. That there is a gift of prayer, which some against all reason do deny. 2. That conceived prayers when uttered by one that hath the gift of prayer, are not vain <hi>Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> or empty repetitions, and a rate of non-sense; as some unjustly charge men with; but they are the breathings of Gods Spirit, that pierce not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ears and hearts of the hearers, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ears and heart of God himself.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:173109:178"/>
                  <p>Tenthly, The next Jewel was, He had great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and communion with God; for he was of a long standing in the School of Christ, and a good Proficient in that School. Much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he had with God, he was often in the Mount with God, and came down with his face shining, though he in his modesty did not see it; and when he came to dye he was able to say as Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> did when he lay a dying, <hi>I shall change my place, but not my company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Another Jewel was, his comfortable passage out of this World, dying with a great deal of calmness and serenity upon his Conscience; The morning before he dyed, I heard him say these words, <hi>It is one thing to speak of Christ, and of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and another thing to feel the consolations of Christ and of Heaven, as I do,</hi> clapping his hand on his breast. Another time I heard him say, <hi>The comforts of a holy life are real, soul-supporting; and that he felt the reallity of those comforts, and that by him we might know it was not in vain to serve God.</hi> And I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this speech the morning before he died, <hi>I am a little straitned, but I care no more for my life, then I do for this fillip:</hi> That which was said of old <hi>Simeon</hi> Luk. 2. may be said of this Reverend Minister, Mr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Ash,</hi> who was a <hi>Simeon,</hi> a just and devout man, an old Servant of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> one that waited for the consolation of <hi>Israel;</hi> one that dyed, though not with Christ in his bodily Arms, yet with Christ in the Arms of his Faith; and when he died, could say as it is there, <hi>Now Lord, lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:173109:178"/>
                  <p>Lastly, Another Jewel was his constancy and perseverance; he was not a Reed shaken with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind, but as firm as a Rock, an immovable Pillar in God's House; he was unchangeable in change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able times; in Religion he was a house built on a Rock, not on the Sand; and as he lived, so he dyed holily, even as the ancient Patriarks that dyed in the Faith, and endured faithfully unto the death.</p>
                  <p>Now this excellent Minister of Christ thus beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with these Jewels, is now perished as to his outward man, gathered to God, to Christ, and the blessed company of Saints and Angels. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that I shall make of this Discourse, is this,
<list>
                        <item>1. To us Ministers.</item>
                        <item>2. To you of this Parish and Congregation.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>First to us Ministers. God hath of late years ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to himself many famous men: Seven of the Lecturers of <hi>Cornhill</hi> are dead, Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sedgewick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cranford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> and now Mr. <hi>Ash.</hi> I might name many other excellent Ministers that are dead, as Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> and lately Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> with many more: Now all these are Warning-pieces from Heaven of Judgements approaching; <hi>For the righteous perish, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the evil to come.</hi> Thus <hi>Methuselah</hi> dyed a year before the Flood: Now <hi>Methuselah</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifies a Messenger of death. Thus <hi>Austin</hi> dyed a little before <hi>Hippo</hi> was taken; and <hi>Pareus</hi> a little before <hi>Hiddleburge</hi> was taken, and <hi>Luther</hi> a little before the Wars in <hi>Germany</hi> began. The death of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:173109:179"/> the godly is like the separating of the Israelites from the tents of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, like the taking of <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodome.</hi> When the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites departed from <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, the earth swallowed them up; and when <hi>Lot</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> God rained down fire and brimstone upon them. Let the thoughts of these things cause us to provide our Arkes, to get our <hi>Zoar</hi>'s. Let it teach young <hi>Samuels,</hi> to rise up in the room of old <hi>Ely's;</hi> young <hi>Elisha</hi>'s, in the room of old <hi>Elijahs,</hi> and young <hi>Timothies,</hi> in the room of <hi>Paul</hi> the aged; that there may be a succession of Gospel Ministers to hold forth the word of life to this Nation. And let us labour to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritours of these twelve excellencies, that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified this our reverend brother.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let me speak a few words to you of this Parish, the auditors of this worthy Minister. There is scarce one man of a hundred, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the tye and obligation that is betwixt a minister and his people. O the love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that ought to be betwixt them! <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that they could a pluckt out their eyes for him if need were. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells us, that when <hi>Miletius</hi> was taken away by death from his people, their hearts sunk with sorrow; and such love had they to him, that they called all their children by his name, and got his picture engraven on their rings. And I have read of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that when he was banished from his people, there was not a corner in the City, but was full of people weeping and lamenting. The loss of a godly minister, is a publick loss, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:173109:179"/> therefore there ought to be publick mourning; it is a soul loss, and therefore, methinks, every one of you should weep and mourn; you have lost your common father; you of this congregation have lost your spiritual father, your spiritual shepheard; you have lost your eyes, your guide; and indeed it is you that are his flock that must commend your minister by practising that which he preached; said the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Do we again begin to commend our selves, or need we as some others, Epistles of commendations to you; or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of commendations from you? Ye are our Epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men.</hi> As if the Apostle should say, do we need letters of commendation? is it necessary that we should spend time in commending our ministry; you are our letters of commendation; your holiness and piety commends a minister above all other things. As when a man comes into an Orchard or Vineyard, said <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and sees every thing skilfully handled, and neatly trimmed, he need not spend time in commending the Vine-dresser or Carpenter; the work it self com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them. So ought it to be among you; when we preach the Funeral Sermons of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, we must look into his Parish or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and see what letters of commendation there are; whether the proficiency of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors commend their Ministers. I grant, it is not always true; God doth not always give success to a godly Minister, but the worst is yours; I had almost said the curse is yours; but I will speak modestly, the worst is yours. Tell me how many
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173109:180"/> of you are able to say, I blesse God that ever such a Minister was sent among us; blessed be God that ever we heard him preach; what seal of his ministry is there here among you? he was in another; and another place in this City; it may be here are people from all places that have been his auditors; what seal of his ministry is there now to be found among you? how many souls hath he pluckt out of the snares of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel? how many of you have gone away weeping from a Sermon, knocking your breasts, and pricked at the hearts for sin, crying out Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved? your tears and mourn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng for sin, these are the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that commend your ministers. Go home now, and think with your selves, What can I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member of all the Sermons that I have heard from Mr. <hi>Ash!</hi> and give me leave to tell you, woe be to you, if as your Minister be dead, so all the Sermons that he made dye with him: For as <hi>Abel</hi> being dead, yet speaketh; so shall the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of this worthy Minister at the great day, speak for you, or against you; for they are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual talents that God hath betrusted you with, and you must be accountable; both he and you shall appear before the Tribunal of God; your Minister shall be examined, how he can free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the guilt of soul blood; and you shall be examined, what fruit you have brought forth, answerable to the means that you have enjoyed; and if it appear that you have been unprofitable and unfruitful hearers, Christ will say, <hi>Cast the unprofitable servant into utter darkness.</hi> But I hope
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173109:180"/> better things of you, and things that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny salvation. Whatever was good in this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>end Minister, let it live in you; and though he be dead, yet let not his sermons that he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dye with you, but let them be in you; that at the great day, when he and you appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, he may be able to say, Here am I, and the Children that thou hast given me.</p>
